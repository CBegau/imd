<h1><a id="eam" name="eam">EAM Potentials (option eam)</a></h1>

<p>The energy in potentials of the Embedded Atom type consitsts of
two parts, a pair potential term specifyed by the function &Phi;(r)
representing the electrostatic core-core repulsion, and a cohesive
term specifyed by the function F(&rho;) representing the energy the
ion core gets when it is "embedded" in the "Electron Sea". This
Embedding Energy is a function of the local electron density, which
in turn is constructed as a superposition of contributions from
neighboring atoms. This electron transfer is specifyed by the
function &Rho;(r).</p>

<p>These functions depend on the type of the embedded atom
(F<sub>i</sub>(&rho;)), or on the types i and j of the two atoms
involved (&Rho;<sub>ij</sub>(r), &Phi;<sub>ij</sub>(r)). The
corresponding tabulated functions can be given in either of two <a
href="potformat.html">formats</a>. Note that &Rho; and &Phi; have
to be tabulated equidistant in r<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The Embedded Atom Method (EAM) was implemented by Erik
Bitzek.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Basic Theory</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The Embedded Atom Method was suggested by Daw and Baskes (M. S.
Daw and M. I. Baskes, <em>Phys. Rev. B</em> <b>29</b>, 6443 (1984);
S. M. Foiles, M. I. Baskes, and M. S. Daw, <em>Phys. Rev. B</em>
<b>33</b>, 7983 (1986)) as a way to overcome the main <a
href="http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~ercolessi/md/md/node47.html#SECTION00630000000000000000">
problem with two-body potentials</a>: the coordination independence
of the bond strength, while still being acceptable fast (about 2
times slower than pair potentials).</p>

<p>Ideas from the Density Functional Theory or the Tight Binding
formalism may lead to the following form for the total energy:</p>

<p>E<sub>tot</sub> = &sum;<sub>i,j</sub><sup>N</sup>
&Phi;<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) + &sum;<sub>i</sub><sup>N</sup>
F(&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>)<br />
&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = &sum;<sub>j</sub>
&Rho;<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)</p>

<p>While an identification of the pair potential term
&Phi;<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) with the electrostatic core-core
repulsion, and of the cohesive term
F(&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>) with the energy the ion core gets
when it is "embedded" in the local electron density
&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> may be tempting, it is nevertheless
without physical justification. Due to invariance properties of the
EAM potential, a embedding energy term linear in the "electron"
density can be described by pair interactions, thus shifting
contributions between embedding and pair energy. So an isolated
consideration of either part is not possible - physical relevance
only lies in the combination of both.</p>

<!-- The pair potential term  \Phi<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) represents  -->
<!-- the electrostatic core-core repulsion, the cohesive term   -->
<!-- F(\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>) represents the energy the ion core -->
<!-- gets when it is "embedded" in the local electron density -->
<!-- \rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>. -->
<p>The local electron density is constructed as a superposition of
contributions &Rho;<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) from
neighboring atoms.</p>

<p>Also belonging to this analytical form are models like the
<em>glue model</em>, and the <em>Finnis-Sinclair potentials</em>.

</dd>

<dt><b>Use of eam</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The eam option works on risc and mpi plattforms. It now uses
actio=reactio between the atoms on the same processor. eam should
work with most of the common options. See <a
href="#Tests">Tests</a> for options that are guaranteed to
work.</p>

<p>To use eam one needs tables of three functions. Therefore the
parameter file should contain lines indicating these tables,
e.g.:</p>

<pre>
core_potential_file     Potentials/Ni_u3/Phi_r2.Ni_u3.dat
embedding_energy_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/F_rho.Ni_u3.dat
atomic_e-density_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/Rho_r2.Ni_u3.dat
</pre>

<p>The potential file can be in either of two different <a
href="potformat.html">formats</a>.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the creator of the potential to make
sure, that the functions of r go smoothly to zero and that the last
four values are 0.0. If you're having an exotic core potential with
V<sub>ij</sub> &ne; V<sub>ji</sub>, you have to use the option <b>asympot</b>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Existing Potentials</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Potentials with documentation and sample structures, parameter
files and tools can be found in <a
href="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/eam"><tt>
~imd/imd-samples/eam</tt></a>. At the moment there are three
potentials for Nickel and one for NiAl.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a id="Tests" name="Tests"><b>Tests</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The eam option was tested by</p>

<ul>
<li>comparing the energy output for a dynamical nve simulation with
those produced by an other MD program (FEAT by Peter Gumbsch)</li>

<li>comparing the simulated values for the cohesive energy, vacancy
formation energy, surface energy, bulkmodulus, lattice constant,
surface relaxation,... for different potentials with published data
for the specific potentials and experimental data</li>

<li>checking the conservation of energy at different
temperatures</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore one may conclude that the eam option leads to correct
results at least for: one and two different atom types, with and
without periodic boundary conditions, on risc and mpi plattforms,
with the MIK, NVE, NVT options.</p>

<p>Ouyang Yifang, Zhang Bangwei et al. (<em>Z. Phys.</em> B <b>101</b>, 161
(1996); <em>Physica</em> B <b>262</b>, 218, (1999)) added a

<p>to the total energy expression E<sub>tot</sub> of the EAM to
account for the difference between the actual total energy of a
system of atoms and that calculated from the original EAM using a
linear superposition of spherically atomic electron densities.
P<sub>i</sub> is defined as the sum of squared "electron"
densities:</p>

<dl>
<dd>P<sub>i</sub> = &sum;<sub>j</sub>

<dt><b>Use of eeam</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Compared to EAM, an additional set of embedding energy functions
M<sub>i</sub> is needed, which are read from a file specified by
the parameter <tt>eeam_energy_file</tt>.</p>
