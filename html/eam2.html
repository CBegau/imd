<h1>Implementation of EAM Potentials</h1>
 
<p>
The Embedded Atom Method (EAM) was implemented by Erik Bitzek. 
<p>
  <ul>
<li><b>Basic Theory</b>
<p>
The Embedded Atom Method was suggested by Daw and Baskes (M. S. Daw
and M. I. Baskes, <EM>Phys. Rev. B </EM><B>29</B>, 6443 (1984);
S. M. Foiles, M. I. Baskes, and M. S. Daw, <EM> Phys. Rev. B </EM>
<B>33</B>, 7983 (1986))
as a way to overcome the main <!-- broken link

problem with two-body potentials<!--</A>-->: the coordination independence of
the bond strength, while still being acceptable fast (about 2 times
slower than pair potentials). 
<p>
Ideas from the Density Functional Theory
or the Tight Binding formalism may lead to the following form for the 
total energy:
<p>
E<sub>tot</sub> = \sum<sub>i,j</sub><sup>N</sup> \Phi<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)   + \sum<sub>i</sub><sup>N</sup> F(\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>)                <BR>
\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = \sum<sub>j</sub>
\Rho<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)  <BR>
<p>
The pair potential term  \Phi<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) represents 
the electrostatic core-core repulsion, the cohesive term  
F(\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>) represents the energy the ion core
gets when it is "embedded" in the local electron density
\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>. This local electron density  
is constructed as a superposition of contributions
\Rho<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) from neighboring
atoms. 
<p>
Also belonging to this analytical form are models like the <EM>glue
model</EM>, and the <EM>Finnis-Sinclair potentials</EM>.

<p>
<li><b>Use of eam</b>
<p>
The eam option works on risc and mpi plattforms. 
It now uses actio=reactio between the atoms on the same processor.
eam should work with most of the common options.
See <A HREF = "#Tests">Tests</A> for options that are guaranteed to work.

<p>
To use eam one needs tables of three functions. 
Therefore the parameter file should contain lines indicating these
tables, e.g.:<p><CODE>
core_potential_file     Potentials/Ni_u3/Phi_r2.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
embedding_energy_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/F_rho.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
atomic_e-density_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/Rho_r2.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
</CODE>
<p>
The potential file can be in either of two different 
<A HREF="potentials.html#POTFORMAT">formats</A>.
<p>
It is the responsibility of the creator of the potential to make
sure, that the functions of r go smoothly to zero and that the last
four values are 0.0. If you're having an exotic core potential with V_ij
!= V_ji, you have to use the option <b>asympot</b>.
<p>
<li><b>Existing Potentials </b>
<p>
Potentials with documentation and sample structures, parameter files
and tools can be found in <a href="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/eam">
<code>~imd/imd-samples/eam</code></a>.
At the moment there are three potentials for Nickel and one for NiAl.
<p>
<li><A NAME = "Tests"><b>Tests </b></A>
<p>
The eam option was tested by
<ul>
<li> comparing the energy output for a dynamical nve simulation with
those produced by an other MD program (FEAT by Peter Gumbsch)
<li> comparing the simulated values for the cohesive energy, vacancy
formation energy, surface energy, bulkmodulus, lattice constant,
surface relaxation,... for different potentials with published data
for the specific potentials  and
experimental data
<li> checking the conservation of energy at different temperatures  
</ul>
<p>
Therefore one may conclude that the eam option leads to correct
results at least for: one and two different atom types, with and
without periodic boundary conditions, on risc and mpi plattforms,
with the MIK, NVE, NVT options.
