<h1>Coulomb Potentials for Ionic Solids</h1>

<p>
Due to their long range nature, Coulomb potentials require a special
treatment. They are enabled with the compilation option <b>ewald</b>,
which refers to the fact that the current implementation uses the 
<b>Ewald summation technique</b>. Coulomb potentials can be combined 
with many other potentials. In particular, an additional short range 
<a href="pairpot.html">two-body potential</a> can be enabled with the 
compilation option <b>pair</b>. In order to allow for
polarizability of the atoms, the <a href="ewald.html#shell">shell 
model</a> is often used together with Coulomb potentials.
The shell model is activated with the option <b>shell</b>.</p> 

<p>
Due to the Ewald summation technique, only three dimensional 
systems with periodic boundary conditions in all directions are 
supported, and the implementation is currently not parallelized.</p>

<p>
The following form of the Ewald sum for a system of <i>N</i> charged 
atoms is implemented:</p>
<center>
  <img src="ewald_trans.gif" />
</center></p>
Here, <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> is the charge of atom <i>i</i>, 
<b>r</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i>
is the distance vector between atoms <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, 
<b>n</b> are linear combinations of the box vectors, and the
prime means that <i>i=j</i> is excluded if <b>n</b>=<b>0</b>.
<i>kappa</i> is a real parameter and erfc(x) is the 
complementary error function.
The sum over <b>k</b> extends over linear combinations of 
the reciprocal vectors of the simulation box.
</p>

<p>
Coulomb potentials can be combined with many other potentials.
In particular, an additional short range <a href="pairpot.html">
two-body potential</a> can be enabled with the compilation option 
<b>pair</b>.</p>

<p>
For the Ewald sum, the following <b>parameters</b> have to be
specified in the <a href="params.html#ewald">parameter file</a>.
The parameter <tt>charge</tt> specifies the charges of all atom 
types (all on one line). The value of <i>kappa</i> is given with
the parameter <tt>ew_kappa</tt>. In the k-space sum, all k-vectors 
within a ball of radius <tt>ew_kcut</tt> are included. 
The parameter <tt>ew_nmax</tt>, whose value is an integer, determines 
the number of image simulation boxes taken into account in computing 
the real space sum. The same number of boxes is included in all three 
directions. If <tt>ew_nmax</tt> is zero, the usual minimum image 
convention is applied. For large systems, the desired real space
cutoff is often smaller than the simulation box. In this case, one
can specify a negative value of <tt>ew_nmax</tt>, which has a special 
meaning: the real space sum then is evaluated together with the other 
pair interactions, up to a cutoff radius <tt>ew_rcut</tt>, which
applies to all pairs of atom types, and which must not be larger than 
the simulation box.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The current implemenation assumes that energies are 
measured in electron volt, lengths in Angstrom, and charges in
units of the elementary charge. Unlike for other interactions,
it is not possible to chose a system of units.

<h1><a id="shell" name="shell">
The Shell Model</a></h1>

<p>
The shell model of Dick and Overhauser (Phys. Rev. <b>112</b>, 90 (1958))
is often used to add polarizability to the atoms of a Coulombic system.
For this purpose, an atom is split into two parts, a charged ionic
core, and a massless, charged shell around the core. By displacing 
the shell with respect to the core, the atom is polarized. Shells 
and cores are treated as separate particles. They all interact with 
<a href="ewald.html">Coulomb interactions</a>. In addition to that,
nearby shells interact with a short range <a href="pairpot.html">pair 
potential</a>, usually of the form of a <a href="pairpot.html#buck">
Buckingham potential</a>, and a harmonic potential (with minimum at
distance zero) acts against the displacement of the core and its 
associated shell. If used together with the option <a href="ewald.html">
ewald</a>, these short range pair potentials have to be enabled
with the compilation option <b>pair</b>.</p>

<p>
The shell is assumed massless, because the (fast moving) electrons 
are expected to be always in their instantaneous ground state. 
This poses a problem in treating the shells as normal particles. 
In principle, the shell positions would have to be fully relaxed 
at each time step, which is very expensive. A way out is to assign 
a very small mass to the shells, so that they move much faster than 
the ionic cores. This requires, however, a correspondingly small 
time step.</p>

<p>
The harmonic potential of the shell model is specified by the
parameter <tt>spring_const</tt>, which requires 
<tt>ntypes*(ntypes-1)/2</tt> values (only particles of different 
types (shells and cores) can interact with this potential).
For type combinations which do not correspond to cores and the
associated shells, the spring constant must be zero. The parameter 
specifying the cutoff radius, <tt>r_cut</tt>, is shared with the 
other <a href="pairpot.html#analyt">analytically defined</a> 
pair potentials. This is no restriction, since shells and cores
are expected to interact only with the harmonic potential.
Similarly, the parameters <tt>r_begin</tt> and <tt>pot_res</tt>
are shared with the <a href="pairpot.html#analyt">analytically defined</a> 
pair potentials. <tt>r_begin</tt> specifies the starting value in
the potential table (which must be zero for type combinations 
interacting with the harmonic potential), and <tt>pot_res</tt>
specifies the number of tabulated values of the potential table.
