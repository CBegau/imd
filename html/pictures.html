<H1>Pictures</H1>

There are several possibilities to make pictures from 2D IMD
simulations. For pictures of 3D simulations we have to refer to
VolIMD, which is a descendant of
<A HREF="http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/RUSuser/vis/People/roland/volrend/volrend.html">VolRend</A>.


<H2>Energy Distribution Pictures</H2>

For energy distribution pictures, the structure is divided into
an array of bins. Each bin corresponds to one pixel, which is
colored according to the total potential or kinetic energy of
the atoms in the bin. Such pictures are suitable for very big
systems.

The first possibility to make such pictures is to write 
<A HREF="output.html#distributions">energy distribution files</A>, 
and make pictures with 
<A HREF="utilities.html">imd_dist2pgm.perl</A>.

The second possibility is to directly write ppm files every 
<TT>pic_int</TT> steps. These files are named
<TT>&lt;outfiles&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.pot.ppm</TT> and
<TT>&lt;outfiles&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.kin.ppm</TT>, repectively.
The relevant parameters are the following:
<UL>

<P><LI>pic_type
<P>Must be 2 for bins

<P><LI>pic_int
<P>Interval (in steps) between picture writes.

<P><LI>Ecut_kin
<P>Lower and upper treshold of kinetic energy (used for coloring)

<P><LI>Ecut_pot
<P>Lower and upper treshold of potential energy (used for coloring)

<P><LI>pic_res
<P>This should be the resolution in pixels. At present, a fixed
   resolution is used.

<P><LI>pic_scale
<P>Zoom into the center of the picture. Should be replaced by
   lower left and upper right corner of the picture.
</UL>


<H2>Atomic Pictures</H2>

For not too big systems, one can make pictures where every single atom
can be seen. At present, IMD can not directly produce such pictures,
but this is planned. They have to be generated after the simulation.

The first possibility is to convert 
<A HREF="config.html">configuration files</A> into ppm files with
the help if <A HREF="utilities.html">imd2ppm</A>. The second
possibility is to write special <TT>.pic</TT> files
containing the raw data needed for the pictures. These can
then be turned into pictures by <A HREF="utilities.html">imd2ppm</A>.
The advantage of the <TT>.pic</TT> files is that
they contain only the data needed for the pictures. Moreover,
they are written in binary format, and so writing and reading
is faster, and they are smaller. The necessary parameters for
the <TT>.pic</TT> files are the following:

<UL>

<P><LI>pic_type
<P>Must be 1 for <TT>.pic</TT> files

<P><LI>pic_int
<P>Interval (in steps) between picture writes.

<P><LI>pic_res
<P>Resolution in pixels in x and y direction. If only one resolution
   is given, the other is chosen such that pixels are approximately square.

<P><LI>pic_ll
<P>Lower left corner of the picture in IMD coordinates.

<P><LI>pic_ur
<P>Upper right corner of the picture in IMD coordinates.

<P><LI>parallel_io
<P>If parallel_io = 2, the .pic files are written in parallel (each CPU
   writes its own atoms to a separate file). All other input/output 
   is serial, however. 
<P>
   If parallel_io = 1, all input/output is parallel, if parallel_io = 0, 
   all input/output is serial. 
</UL>

Only atoms in a frame spanned by the paramters pic_ll (lower left
corner) and pic_ur (upper right corner) are written. By default, this
frame is set to the whole system.
<P>
Under the <A HREF="options.html#disloc">disloc</A> option, instead
of the actual potential energy the difference to a reference
potential energy is written to the .pic files.
<P>
If the compilation flag <B>ZOOM</B> is defined, only partial configuration
files (checkpoints - which the no longer work as checkpoints!) 
consisting of the atoms inside the frame defined by pic_ll and pic_ur
are written. It is probably better to use the .pic files to make 
partial pictures, though.
