<h1>Potential File Format</h1>

<p>
Some of the interactions supported by IMD are defined in terms of 
tabulated functions. Typical such functions are central pair
potentials, which depend on the distance of two atoms and the two atom 
types involved. Such functions have to be tabulated with steps which 
are equidistant in the <b>square of the distance</b>. For EAM 
interactions one also needs functions which depend on one atom type 
and the host electron density at the position of that atom. Such 
functions are tabulated with steps equidistant in the electron
density.</p>

<h2>Potential File Header</h2>

<p>
Tabulated functions can be given in either of two formats. The header
specifies in which format the current file is, and how many data
columns the tabulated function has for each argument. The number
of data columns is either the number of atom type pairs (i.e., the
square of the number of atom types), or, in the case of the EAM host 
electron density, the number of atom types. The header has the
following format:</p>

<pre>
## this is just a comment line
#F f n
## this is another comment line
#E this is the very last header line
</pre>

</p>
Header lines start with the character '#'. If the second character is
'F', then the format specifyer f (either 1 or 2) and the number n of 
data columns of the tabulated functions are read from the rest of the 
line. The very last header line must have a character 'E' at the 
second position. Header lines with a second character different from 
'F' or 'E' are treated as comments, but it is recommended that such 
lines start with two '#' characters. </p>

<h2>Format 1</h2>

<p>
In a potential file in format 1, each line contains first the function 
argument, either the square of the distance (radius) or the host 
electron density, and then all data columns, i.e., the function values 
for this argument for the different atom type pairs or atom types. 
If the atom types run from 0 to N, the lines in a format 1 file have
either of the following formats:</p>

<pre>
r^2    V_00 V_01 ... V_0N V_10 V_11 ... V_NN 
</pre>
<pre>
rho_h  E_0 ... E_N
</pre>

<p>
Note that if a function of the square of the distance given in format
1 does not vanish at the end of the tabulation, it is shifted so that
it does vanish. This is for backwards compatibility; it would be
better to change the potential file once and for all.</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of format 1 is that all data columns have to be tabulated
for the same range and with the same spacing. </p>
 
<h2>Format 2</h2>

<p>
In a potential file in format 2, each data column has its own range
and spacing. If we have n data columns, the file starts with n lines
of the form
<pre>
x_begin x_end dx
</pre>
specifying the start, end, and spacing of the tabulation of the
n data columns. The argument x is either the square of the atom 
distance, or the host electron density. These n lines are then
followed by n blocks with the function values, one for each atom 
type pair or atom type. The number of function values is computed 
from the begin, end, and spacing values of the corresponding table.
They can be different for the different data columns. The order
of the different data columns is as described for format 1.</p>

<h2>Backwards Compatibility</h2>

<p>
For backwards compatibility, potential files without header are also 
accepted, but a warning is printed. A default format is then assumed,
which is format 2 for EAM interactions, and format 1 for everything else.</p>
