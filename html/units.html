<h1>Units</h1>

<p>
IMD does not need a particular system of units. It can work with any
system. The units used by IMD are implicitly defined in the configuration
and potential files, and possibly by certain parameters specifying
the potential. The configuration file contains atom positions and
atom masses, which implicitly defines a length unit and a mass unit,
respectively. The interaction potential implicitly makes use of a 
length unit and an energy unit. Of course, this length unit must be the 
same as for the configuration file. The three units of lenth, mass, and
energy determine all other units, which are derived from them.
The temperature is always given in energy units.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
If the length unit is 1&nbsp;Angstrom = 1e-10&nbsp;m, the energy unit
1&nbsp;eV = 1.602e-19&nbsp;J (which corresponds to 11594&nbsp;K), and 
the mass unit is 1&nbsp;amu = 1.66e-27&nbsp;kg, we have for the unit 
of time 1.018e-14&nbsp;s = 10.18&nbsp;fs. The unit of pressure then 
is 160.2&nbsp;GPa = 1602&nbsp;kbar.</p>
