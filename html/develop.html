<H1>Developer's Corner</H1>

Here we give some hints on how to extend IMD. In particular, we list
some common pitfalls that are to be avoided.

<H2>Naming conventions for files</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Source files are all named with lower case letters
<LI> Dimension specific files have the dimension in their name
  (e.g. imd_geom_2d.c)
<LI> Names for architecture specific files contain the architecture in
  their name (e.g. imd_main_risc.c, imd_main_mpi.c)
<LI> Non-source files in the source directory begin with a capital letter
  (e.g. Makefile, README, INSTALL)
<LI> Documentation files should be written in English and in HTML
(preferably) or LaTeX.
</UL>

<H2>Introducing new parameters</H2>

Before a new parameter can be used, it must be
<UL>
<LI>declared and initialized to default value (in file globals.h)
<LI>read into IMD (routine getparamfile() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>possibly checked for nonsense values (routine
    check_parameters_complete() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>broadcast to the other CPUs (routine broadcast_params() in
    file imd_param.c)
</UL>

<H2>Extending the particle data structure</H2>

Each particle in IMD carries a number of data items with it.
If a is particle moved to a different cell, or even a different
CPU, these data must be moved as well. They always remain with
the particle.
<P>
In order to extend the particle data structure, the following
must be done:
<UL>
<LI> the declaration of the type <TT>cell</TT> must be extended
     with the new data item (in file types.h)</LI>
<LI> the allocation routine alloc_cell() for the particle data
     must be extended (file imd_alloc.c)</LI>
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle 
     from one cell to another cell within the same CPU, the routine
     move_atom() in file imd_alloc.c must be extended</LI>
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle
     from one CPU to another CPU, two things must be done: 
     <UL>
     <LI> the routines copy_one_atom() und process_buffer() in file
          imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. These routines pack/unpack 
          selected atoms with their data into/from a communications
	  buffer.</LI>
     <LI> the routines send_cell() und recv_cell() in file</LI>
          imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. These routines send and
          receive entire cells.</LI>
     </UL></LI>
<LI> if the force computation requires further data besides the atom 
     types and positions (like the direction of a non-pointlike
     particle), these must be sent to the buffer cells.<BR>
     There are two modes of operation:
     <UL>
     <LI>If AR is not defined (default in 2d, but not in 3d), which
         is the simpler case, the routine copy_atoms() in file 
         imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. It copies for all particles 
         in a cell the data needed for the force computation into a 
         communication buffer. This buffer is unpacked with the
	 routine process_buffer() (see above), which must also be 
         adapted. process_buffer() has two modes, FORCE and ATOMS. 
         The first section of process_buffer is executed in both 
         modes and unpacks items needed for the force computation, 
         whereas the second section, executed only in ATOMS mode, 
         unpacks the remaining items. All this must be done in the 
         right order!</LI>
     <LI>If AR is defined, the routines copy_atoms_ar(),
	 move_atoms_ar() in file imd_mpi_main_3d.c must be
         extended, so that they copy and move also the new
         components needed for the force computation.
         If the "force" includes also moments acting on non-pointlike
         particles, it is recommended that the non-AR mode is used.
         For this, the preprocessor symbol AR should be undefined in 
         config.h. Otherwise, these generalized force components 
         would have to be sent back to the original cells
         and added up there. This is done by the routines 
         copy_forces() and add_forces() in imd_mpi_util.c 
         AR mode is not (yet) available in 2d.</LI>
     </UL>
</UL>

Examples for such extensions of the particle data structure can
be found by looking for the preprocessor flags REFPOS or DISLOC
in the files mentioned.

<H2>Revision Control System: CVS</H2>

Starting with IMD 1.2 we are managing IMD with the CVS software
maintenance system. A description of the basic commands can be found
in the <A HREF="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/page2/itapsoft/simulation/imd-doc/">imd-doc</A> directory.

To simplify the version control with CVS each developer is urged to
include the following lines of comment at the beginning of each new source
code file:
<P>

/****************************************************************<BR>
* $RCSfile$<BR>
* $Revision$<BR>
* $Date$<BR>
*****************************************************************/<BR>
<P>
CVS replaces these lines automatically with the correct
version numbers, if the new file is checked into the CVS repository.
