<H1>Limitations of the current implemetation of IMD</H1>
<P>
The current implemetation of IMD has certain limitations, of which
a user should be aware. Some of them are listed here, to avoid
misunderstandings and errors. Most of them concern limited 
multiphase simulation capabilities.
<P>
The type of <B>boundary conditon</B> (periodic or free) is global
to an entire IMD executable, not only to an entire simulation.
Certain ensembles and options (frac, pull, mikshear) require free 
boundary conditions, and switch off periodic boundary conditions
for all other components in the executable.
The option <B>shock</B> does this with boundary conditions in
x-direction only.
<P>
Certain ensembles and options do some <B>initialization</B> during 
startup. This is still the case for <B>shock</B>, which can therefore
be used only for the first simulation phase.
<P>
Atoms with negative numbers are not moved by certain integrators,
but are rigidly moved when the sample is sheared or deformed
in other ways. The set of atoms with negative numbers remains
the same throughout the whole simulation.
<P>
Certain features can not (yet) be switched on and off during a
simulation. Once compiled into an executable, they are active all
the time. Such features therefore only have limited <B>multiphase</B> 
capabilities. There are probably no such features left :-)
<P>
The type of <B>interaction</B> (pair potentials, EAM potentials, 
two- and three-body potentials) is global to an entire IMD executable.
The potential tables can not be changed during a simulation.
<P>
The option <B>stress_tens</B> is not implemented for three body
potentials. The option is limited to the diagonal part of the stress
tensor, and the stress tensor distribution is averaged over the y- and
z-coordinate (in 3d).
