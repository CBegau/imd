<H1>IMD Potentials</H1>
As a default, IMD uses classical two-body potentials, which are
tabulated in the potential file. Each line gives the potential
values at one value of r^2 (square of the radius). If N is ntypes-1,
the format of each line is:
<PRE>
r^2 V_00 V_01 ... V_0N V_10 V_11 ... V_NN 
</PRE>
It is <B>important</B> that the values of <B>r^2</B> at which the potential
is given are <B>equidistant</B>. If the potential does not extend 
down to r=0, it is extrapolated linearly. Further, IMD adds a
constant to the potential, so that it ends at zero.

<H2>Finnis Sinclair Potentials: eam</H2>

The pair interaction potential is used as described in 
'IMD Potentials'. The cohesive energy term is computed
during the run. The explicit form of the cohesive energy
function depends on the elements considered. In IMD the
potential functions optimized for molybdenum are available.
<p>
However, the change of the analytical cohesive energy 
function and its first derivative should be straightforward.

<H2>General EAM Potentials: eam2</H2>
The energy in potentials of the Embedded Atom type consitsts of two
parts:<p>
A pair potential term (Phi(r)) representing the electrostatic core-core
repulsion, and a cohesive term (F(rho)) representing the energy the ion
core gets when it is "embedded" in the "Electron Sea". 
This Embedding Energy is a function of the local electron density.
This local electron density is in turn constructed as a superposition
of contributions from neighboring atoms (Rho(r)).
<p> 
These functions depend on the type of atom i (F_i(rho)) and of the type of
the other atom j (Rho_ij(r), Phi_ij(r)). We use function tables for
all of them, the number of atom types n is limited only by memory.
The format of the tables (equidistant in r^2) for Rho(r), Phi(r) is:
<p>
n*n times: r_begin r_end dr <p>
followed by n*n blocks of function values for the n*n
possible atom pairs ij: 00, 01,... 10, 11,...
<p>
F(rho) is tabulated equidistant in rho, beginning with n times rho_begin
rho_end drho followed by n blocks of values.

<H2>Two- and Three-Body Potentials</H2>

The pair interaction potential is used as described in 
'IMD Potentials'. The three-body interaction potential
is computed during the run. The explicit form of the 
latter term is still under development. Only three-body 
test potentials are available right now.

<a href=ttbp.html>TTBP implementation</a>.

<H2>Gay-Berne Potential</H2>

The Gay-Berne potential models the pair interaction 
of uniaxial molecules. It depends not only on the scalar
distance of their centres of mass but also on their
mutual orientation. Due to this complicated dependence
the Gay-Berne interaction cannot be tabulated. In IMD
it is calculated from its analytical expression. Forces
and torques are also evaluated analytically as 
derivatives of the potential.
