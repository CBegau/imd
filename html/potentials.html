<h1>Interactions</h1>

<p>
IMD supports a large variety of different (mostly short range)
effective potentials. Some of these potentials are defined by tabulated
functions read from a <a href="potformat.html">potential file</a>,
others are defined analytically by parameters read from the
<a href="paramfile.html">parameter file</a>. The potentials
supported include <a href="pairpot.html">central pair potentials</a>,
<a href="eam2.html">Embedded Atom Method (EAM)</a> potentials for 
metals, <a href="meam.html">Modified EAM (MEAM)</a> potentials,
different <a href="covalent.html">covalent potentials</a>,
notably <a href="covalent.html#tersoff">Tersoff</a>,
Stillinger-Weber (<a href="covalent.html#stiweb">analytic</a>
and <a href="covalent.html#ttbp">tabulated</a>), Zhou-Wadley
(<a href="covalent.html#ternbcc">analytic</a>
and <a href="covalent.html#ttbpxt">tabulated</a>), and 
<a href="covalent.html#keating">Keating</a> potentials,
<a href="ewald.html">Coulomb</a> and <a href="ewald.html#shell">shell 
model</a> potentials for ionic solids, and
<a href="uniax.html">Gay-Berne</a> potentials for nematic
liquid crystals.</p>

<p>
Since the computation of the forces is the most time-critical part
of a molecular dynamics simulation, support for each type of
interaction has to be enabled explicitly by a compilation option.
If no interaction type is specified, central pair potentials
are assumed by default. Different interaction types can be
combined with each other, by enabling more than one type
of interaction. Their contributions are then just added. This is 
still somewhat experimental, and there are some restrictions.
Here are some guidelines:
<ul>
<li>At most <b>one</b> of the <a href="covalent.html">covalent  
    potentials</a> (including <a href="meam.html">MEAM</a>, which
    is algorithmically similar) can be used at a time.</li>
<li>Central <a href="pairpot.html">pair potentials</a>, 
    <a href="eam2.html">EAM potentials</a>, and one of 
    <a href="covalent.html#tersoff">Tersoff</a> or Stillinger-Weber
    potentials (<a href="covalent.html#ttbp">tabulated</a>
    or <a href="covalent.html#stiweb">analytic</a>) 
    <b>can be combined</b> with each other. 
    The central pair potential part contained in these interactions 
    is <b>shared</b>.</li>
<li>The option <b>pair</b> can be used to enable a (short range)
    <a href="pairpot.html">pair potential</a> part together with 
    <a href="ewald.html">Coulomb</a> potentials.
    The same option is also used to enable the harmonic potential
    used for the <a href="ewald.html#shell">shell model</a> in 
    combination with <a href="ewald.html">Coulomb interactions</a>.</li> 
<li><a href="ewald.html">Coulomb potentials</a> can be combined with 
    almost everything else, whether or not this makes sense.</li>
<li><a href="covalent.html#keating">Keating</a> and 
    <a href="uniax.html">Gay-Berne</a> potentials <b>cannot</b> be 
    combined with anything else.</li>
<li>On vector machines, add the option "lj" for computed Lennard-Jones
  interactions.
</ul>
