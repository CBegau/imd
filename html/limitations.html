<h1>Limitations of the current implemetation</h1>

<p>
The current implemetation of IMD has certain limitations, of which
a user should be aware. Some of them are listed here, to avoid
misunderstandings and errors. Most of them concern limited 
multiphase simulation capabilities.</p>

<p>
Certain ensembles and options do some <b>initialization</b> during 
startup. This is still the case for <b>shock</b> and <b>laser</b>. For a
correct restart it may be necessary to change certain parameters.</p>

<p>
Atoms with negative numbers are not moved by certain integrators,
but are rigidly moved when the sample is sheared or deformed
in other ways. The set of atoms with negative numbers remains
the same throughout the whole simulation.</p>

<p>
The type of <b>interaction</b> (pair potentials, EAM potentials, 
two- and three-body potentials, Coulomb potential) is global 
to an entire IMD executable. The potential tables can not be 
changed during a simulation.</p>
