Here we give some hints on how to extend IMD. In particular, we list
some common pitfalls that are to be avoided.

<H2>Introducing new parameters</H2>

Before a new parameter can be used, it must be
<UL>
<LI>declared and initialized to default value (in file globals.h)
<LI>read into IMD (routine getparamfile() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>possibly checked for nonsense values (routine
    check_parameters_complete() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>broadcast to the other CPUs (routine broadcast_params() in
    file imd_param.c)
</UL>

<H2>Extending the particle data structure</H2>

Each particle in IMD carries a number of data items with it.
If a is particle moved to a different cell, or even a different
CPU, these data must be moved as well. They always remain with
the particle.
<P>
In order to extend the particle data structure, the following
must be done:
<UL>
<LI> the declaration of the type <TT>cell</TT> must be extended
     with the new data item (in file types.h)
<LI> the allocation routine alloc_cell() for the particle data
     must be extended (file imd_alloc.c)
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle 
     from one cell to another cell within the same CPU, the routine
     move_atom() in file imd_alloc.c must be extended
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle
     from one CPU to another CPU, two things must be done: 
     <UL>
     <LI> the routines copy_one_atom() und process_buffer() in file
          imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. These routines pack/unpack 
          selected atoms with their data into/from a communications buffer.
     <LI> the routines send_cell() und recv_cell() in file
          imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. These routines send and
          receive entire cells.
     </UL>
</UL>

Examples for such extensions of the particle data structure can
be found by looking for the preprocessor flags REFPOS or DISLOC
in the files mentioned.
