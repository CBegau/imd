<h1>Interactions</h1>

<a name="POTFORMAT">
<h2>Potential File Format</h2>
</a>

<p>
IMD supports several different kinds of interactions. Most of them
are defined in terms of tabulated functions. Typical such functions 
are central pair potentials, which depend on the distance of two atoms 
and the two atom types involved. Such functions have to be tabulated 
with steps which are equidistant in the <b>square of the distance</b>. 
For EAM interactions one also needs functions which depend on one 
atom type and the host electron density at the position of that atom. 
Such functions are tabulated with steps equidistant in the electron
density.</p>

<h3>Potential File Header</h3>

<p>
Tabulated functions can be given in either of two formats. The header
specifies in which format the current file is, and how many data
columns the tabulated function has for each argument. The number
of data columns is either the number of atom type pairs (i.e., the
square of the number of atom types), or, in the case of the EAM host 
electron density, the number of atom types. The header has the
following format:</p>

<pre>
## this is just a comment line
#F f n
## this is another comment line
#E this is the very last header line
</pre>

</p>
Header lines start with the character '#'. If the second character is
'F', then the format specifyer f (either 1 or 2) and the number n of 
data columns of the tabulated functions are read from the rest of the 
line. The very last header line must have a character 'E' at the 
second position. Header lines with a second character different from 
'F' or 'E' are treated as comments, but it is recommended that such 
lines start with two '#' characters. </p>

<h3>Format 1</h3>

<p>
In a potential file in format 1, each line contains first the function 
argument, either the square of the distance (radius) or the host 
electron density, and then all data columns, i.e., the function values 
for this argument for the different atom type pairs or atom types. 
If the atom types run from 0 to N, the lines in a format 1 file have
either of the following formats:</p>

<pre>
r^2    V_00 V_01 ... V_0N V_10 V_11 ... V_NN 
</pre>
<pre>
rho_h  E_0 ... E_N
</pre>

<p>
Note that if a function of the square of the distance given in format
1 does not vanish at the end of the tabulation, it is shifted so that
it does vanish. This is for backwards compatibility; it would be
better to change the potential file once and for all.</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of format 1 is that all data columns have to be tabulated
for the same range and with the same spacing. </p>
 
<h3>Format 2</h3>

<p>
In a potential file in format 2, each data column has its own range
and spacing. If we have n data columns, the file starts with n lines
of the form
<pre>
x_begin x_end dx
</pre>
specifying the start, end, and spacing of the tabulation of the
n data columns. The argument x is either the square of the atom 
distance, or the host electron density. These n lines are then
followed by n blocks with the function values, one for each atom 
type pair or atom type. The number of function values is computed 
from the begin, end, and spacing values of the corresponding table.
They can be different for the different data columns. The order
of the different data columns is as described for format 1.</p>

<h3>Backwards Compatibility</h3>

<p>
For backwards compatibility, potential files without header are also 
accepted, but a warning is printed. A default format is then assumed,
which is format 2 for EAM interactions, and format 1 for everything else.</p>

<a name="PAIRPOT">
<h2>Central Pair Potentials</h2>
</a>

<p>
As a default, IMD uses classical, central two-body potentials, which
are tabulated in the potential file. The potential file can be in
either of two <a href="#POTFORMAT">formats</a>. It is essential that
the potential is tabulated equidistant in the <b>square</b> of the
atom distance. Note that if the potential does not extend down to
r^2=0, it is extrapolated linearly. In the options <b>tersoff</b> and
<b>ewald</b>, tabulated pair potentials are not used by default. In
these cases, the option <b>pair</b> can be chosen to use an additional
pair potential.</p>

<p>
IMD allows to use some <a href="predefined_potentials.html">predefined pair
potentials</a>. (options <b>lj</b>, <b>morse</b>, and <b>buck</b>) In
this case, the forces are either computed analytically during the
simulation or from a potential table created at the start of the
simulation.</p>

<a name="EAMPOT">
<h2>EAM Potentials (option eam)</h2>
</a>

<p>
The energy in potentials of the Embedded Atom type consitsts of two
parts, a pair potential term specifyed by the function Phi(r)
representing the electrostatic core-core repulsion, and a cohesive
term specifyed by the function F(rho) representing the energy the ion
core gets when it is "embedded" in the "Electron Sea". This Embedding 
Energy is a function of the local electron density, which in turn
is constructed as a superposition of contributions from neighboring 
atoms. This electron transfer is specifyed by the function Rho(r).</p>

<p> 
These functions depend on the type of the embedded atom (F_i(rho)), 
or on the types i and j of the two atoms involved (Rho_ij(r), Phi_ij(r)). 
The corresponding tabulated functions can be given in either of
two <a href="#POTFORMAT">formats</a>. Note that Rho and Phi have
to be tabulated equidistant in r^2.</p>

<a href=eam2.html>EAM implementation</a></p>

<h2>Keating Potential (option keating)</h2>
</a>

<p>
For the option keating, the Keating potential is computed analytically
in the IMD implementation. The potential parameters have to be given in
the parameter file.</p>

<p>
For more details take a look at the description of the 
<a href="covalent.html#keating">KEATING implementation</a>.</p>

<h2>Stillinger-Weber Potentials (options stiweb and ttbp)</h2>

<p>
For the option stiweb, the Stillinger-Weber potential is computed
analytically in the IMD implementation. The potential parameters have
to be given in the parameter file.</p>

<p>
The option ttbp uses a general pair interaction potential which has to
be given in a potential table as described for simulations with 
<a href="#PAIRPOT">pair potentials</a>. The three-body interaction
potential is computed from parameters. However, a cutoff function has
to be specified. Its possible input formats can be the same as for the
pair potential.</p>

<p>
For more details take a look at the description of the 
<a href="covalent.html">STIWEB and TTBP implementation</a>.</p>

<a name="TERSOFFPOT">
<h2>Tersoff Potential (option tersoff)</h2>
</a>

<p>
The Tersoff potential is computed analytically in the
IMD implementation. A set of parameters, however, has
to be given in the parameter file.</p>

<p>
For more details take a look at the description of the 
<a href="covalent.html#tersoff">TERSOFF implementation</a>.</p>

<a name="EWALDPOT">
<h2>Coulomb Potential (option ewald)</h2>
</a>

<p>
The Coulomb potential is computed using Ewald summation
technique. An additional short range pair interaction
potential can be used.</p>
 
<p>
For more details take a look at the description ot the
<a href="ewald.html">EWALD implementation</a>.</p>

<a name="SPRING">
<h2>Harmonic Potential (option spring)</h2>
</a>

<p>
This potential can be used together with Coulomb potentials and other
short range pair potentials in the shell model. Only the spring
constants for atoms of different type have to be specified in the
paramter file. </p>

<a name="GAYBERNEPOT">
<h2>Gay-Berne Potential (option uniax)</h2>
</a>

<p>
The Gay-Berne potential models the pair interaction 
of uniaxial molecules. It depends not only on the scalar
distance of their centres of mass but also on their
mutual orientation. Due to this complicated dependence
the Gay-Berne interaction cannot be tabulated. In IMD
it is calculated from its analytical expression. Forces
and torques are also evaluated analytically as 
derivatives of the potential.</p>

<a href=uniax.html>UNIAX implementation</a>.</p>
