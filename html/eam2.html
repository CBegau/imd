Implementation of EAM2</font></H1> 
<p>
The Embedded Atom Method (EAM) was implemented by Erik Bitzek. It is more
general than the <a href=eam.html>eam implementation</a> because it is
not limited to potentials of the Finnis-Sinclair type.
<p>
  <ul>
<li><b>Basic Theory</b>
<p>
The Embedded Atom Method was suggested by Daw and Baskes (M. S. Daw
and M. I. Baskes, <EM>Phys. Rev. B </EM><B>29</B>, 6443 (1984);
S. M. Foiles, M. I. Baskes, and M. S. Daw, <EM> Phys. Rev. B </EM>
<B>33</B>, 1986)
as a way to overcome the main <A
HREF="http://poirot.sissa.it/~furio/md/md/node47.html#SECTION00630000000000000000">
problem with two-body potentials</A>: the coordination independance of
the bond strenght. Ideas from the Density Functional Theory or the Tight
Binding formalism may lead to the following form for the total energy:
<p>
E<sub>tot</sub> = \sum<sub>i,j</sub><sup>N</sup> \Phi<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)   + \sum<sub>i</sub><sup>N</sup> F(\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>)                <BR>
\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = \sum<sub>j</sub>
\Rho<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)  <BR>
<p>
The pair potential term  \Phi<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) represents 
the electrostatic core-core repulsion, the cohesive term  
F(\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>) represents the energy the ion core
gets when it is "embedded" in the local electron density
\rho<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>. This local electron density  
is constructed as a superposition of contributions
\Rho<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) from neighboring
atoms. 
<p>
Also belonging to this analytical form are models like the <EM>glue
model</EM>, and the <EM>Finnis-Sinclair potentials</EM>.

<p>
<li><b>Use of eam2</b>
<p>
The eam2 option currently works on risc and mpi plattforms. It does
definitvely not work with PVPCRAY or SX4, neither with 2D, ORDPAR or
TRANSPORT. See <A HREF = "#Tests">Tests</A>
for options that are guaranteed to work.

<p>
To use eam2 one needs tables of three functions. 
Therefore the parameter file should contain lines indicating these
tables, e.g.:<p><CODE>
core_potential_file     Potentials/Ni_u3/Phi_r2.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
embedding_energy_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/F_rho.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
atomic_e-density_file   Potentials/Ni_u3/Rho_r2.Ni_u3.dat<BR>
</CODE>
<p>
To allow different stepwidths and starting/ending points for the
potentials, the tables have the following format: 
<p>
core_potential_file, atomic_e-density_file:  <BR>
n*n lines with:<br>
<tt>r_begin r_end dr </tt><BR>
followed by n*n blocks of function values (equidistant in r^2) <BR>
for the atom pairs ij: 00, 01,... 10, 11,... 
<p>
embedding_energy_file:<br>
n lines with: <br>
<tt>rho_begin rho_end drho </tt><br>
followed by n blocks of values equidistant in rho
<p>
<li><b>Existing Potentials (todo/work in progress!)</b>
<p>
Potentials with documentation and sample structures, parameter files
and tools can be found in <a href="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/eam2">
<code>~imd/imd-samples/eam2</code></a>.
At the moment there are two potentials for Nickel and one for NiAl.
<p> 
<li><A NAME = "Tests"><b>Tests (todo/work in progress!)</b></A>
<p>
The eam2 option was tested by
<ul>
<li> comparing the energy output for a dynamical nve simulation with
those produced by an other MD program (FEAT by Peter Gumbsch)
<li> comparing the simulated values for the cohesive energy, vacancy
formation energy, surface energy, bulkmodulus, lattice constant,
surface relaxation,... for different potentials with published data
for the specific potentials  and
experimental data
<li> checking the conservation of energy at different temperatures  
</ul>
<p>
Therefore one may conclude that the eam2 option leads to correct
results at least for: one and two different atom types, with and
without periodic boundary conditions, on risc and mpi plattforms,
with the MIK, NVE, NVT, AND options.
