<H1>Making Samples</H1>

In the directory <B>imd-samples</B>, there are several subdirectories
for different kinds of structures. For each of these, these
directories should eventually contain sample configurations, 
programs to make such sample configurations, sample parameter 
files, sample output files, etc.
<P>
At present, there are programs to make sample configurations for
the following structures:
<UL>
<LI> <B>alcuco</B>
<P> 
Periodic approximants of the Zeger model of decagonal AlCuCo quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/alcuco/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>bin2d</B>
<P>
Periodic approximants of 2d binary tiling quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/bin2d/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>ibt3d</B> (also known as <B>tiqc</B>)
<P>
Periodic approximants of icosahedral binary tiling quasicrystals,
also known as trucated icosahedra quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/ibt3d/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>fcc</B>
<P>
FCC crystals. The program imd_make_fcc.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac or deform simulations).
<P> 
<LI><B>nacl</B>
<P>
NaCl crystals. The program imd_make_fcc.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac or deform simulations).
<P> 
<LI><B>hex</B>
<P>
Hexagonal crystals. The program imd_make_hex.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac or deform simulations).
<P>
<LI><B>eam</B>
<P>
As one is usually using eV, Angstroms and picosec as basic units with
the eam option, there are some programs to make samples that uses
these units and rescale the mass to eV*psec^2/angstrom^2.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>LEGO</b> (<b>L</b>attice <b>E</b>lemental <b>G</b>eometry <b>O</b>perations)
<p>
For FCC crystals (should be easily changable to other crystal
structures). One can widly rotate and cut the crystal, and by putting
together different output files generate more complex structures like
Grain Boundaries. Of course one can also generate a 'normal' FCC
configuration... <BR> 
The program reads the needed parameters (like lattice 
constant, the mass in amu, the box size, rotation vector and angles,
cutting plane normals, starting atom number,... please refere to the
<a href="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/eam/Structures/LEGO/ex.confparam">
<code>example</code></a>) from a parameter file. <BR>
 Besides the outputfile LEGO procures
information about the minimal periodic cell size and the starting atom
number for possible further configurations to add.  <p>
LEGO is still under construction and comments or suggestions are
welcome (<A HREF="mailto:erik@itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de">erik@itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de</A>). 
For more information refere to the <a href="file:/common/share/itap/software/simulation/imd-samples/eam/Structures/LEGO/README">
README</a>.
<p>
<li> <b>B2</b>
<p>
B2 (CsCl) crystals. The program mkB2.c asks for the output file, the
lattice constant, the two masses in amu, the box size, 
and whether to leave empty a boundary strip (for frac or deform simulations).
</ul>
