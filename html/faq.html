<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Compilation problems: use gnumake! Gnumake for Cray T3E: ask
Marco Brunelli.
<P><DT>2.
<DD>Restart: The number of additional steps has to be added to the
  number of steps which have been run already. The total number of
  steps is no difference but the absolute number of steps.
<P><DT>3.
<DD>(Dieter Wolfangel) Units: IMD uses no unit system by
  itself. What counts are the units in which the potential has been
  computed.
<P>
Particularly, IMD does not use reduced units. But if the potential
  tabales are computed from standard Lennard-Jones interactions, it
  seems as if reduced units are applied.
<P>
It is suitable to scale the values of mass, atom distance and energy
  in such a way that there absolut value is of the order 1. For
  example the mass in Dekau (10 atomic units), the atom distance in 
  &#197;ngstr&#248;m (10 nm), and the energy in mRy (13.56 meV).
<P>
For aluminium (1.66<SUP>-26</SUP>kg) one gets a factor
  mass<SUP>1/2</SUP>*length/energy<SUP>1/2</SUP> equal to 2.7<SUP>-13</SUP> for the
  rescaling of the time unit 1 into seconds.
<P>
Thus the upper limit for a time step should be 0.01 (fs), if the
  phonons with the highest frequency shall still be resolved (Debye
  temperature 400K, equivalent to 8.3<SUP>12</SUP> Hz or 1.2<SUP>-13</SUP> s).
<P>
The IMD temperature 1 is equivalent to 157 Kelvin (energy/k<SUB>B</SUB>).
<P><DT>4.
<DD>(Christof) To make an atom immobile the running atom number must
  be negative, but not the atom type!
<P><DT>5.
<DD>(Christof) Segmentation faults: 
  <UL>
<LI> call unlimit first
<LI> test the file formats and remove unnecessary columns.
  </UL>
<P><DT>6.

QUESTION : I have changed the potential table, and the program gives me 
strange results.
<P>
ANSWER : The problem can be the potential table itself. IMD needs
a potential table in which the values of the potential are computed
in points EQUALLY displaced in <I>r<SUP>2</SUP></I>, and not in r.
<P>
QUESTION : I have used the displacement field of a crack, and I have
scaled it to obtain a new start configuration relative to scaled
boundary conditions as well, but the energies after very few time steps
diverges.
<P>
ANSWER : The problem is that the displacement field is ill-conditioned
in the neighborhood of the crack tip. The possible solutions are two:
<P>
1) You use a smaller time step, but this solution is not recommended,
for you're using a different dynamic induced by potologic initial
conditions.
<P>
2) You have to reach you displacement field step-by-step. Just scale
your initial configuration of a smaller value. Then let it relaxe for
very few time step, and rescale the output configuration of a little
values again, and so on till you have reached the desired value of
displacement during relaxation of intermediate configurations. The final
configuration will be the right initial configuration of your problem.
<P><DT>7.
<DD>IMD uses the full minimal image condition, i.e. each atom is placed
back into the original sample. This may give wrong results in
diffusion simulations.
