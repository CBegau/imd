<UL>

<A NAME="2d">
<P><LI><B>2d</B><P>
</A>
2d simulation rather than 3d. The option 3d also exists - it is the
default.

<A NAME="msqd">
<P><LI><B>msqd</B><P>
</A>
This option enables the computation of the <B>mean square 
displacements</B> (MSQDs) (for each atom type and each direction
separately). It shares its parameters with the option correl. 
The computation of the MSQDs is started at step 
<TT>correl_start</TT>, and ends at step <TT>correl_end</TT>. 
The reference positions are first stored at step 
<TT>correl_start</TT>, and then they are reset every
<TT>correl_int</TT> steps (or never, if <TT>correl_int=0</TT>, 
which is the default). The MSQDs are computed every <TT>correl_ts</TT> 
steps between <TT>correl_start</TT> and <TT>correl_end</TT>,
and are written to the file <TT>&lt;outfiles&gt;.msqd</TT>,
preceeded by the current simulation time. The format of the msqd file
is:
<PRE>
  time d2x_1 d2y_1 [d2z_1] [d2x_2 d2y_2 [d2z_2]] ...
</PRE>
where <TT>d2x_n</TT> is the mean square displacement of particles of
type <TT>n</TT> in <TT>x</TT> direction, etc.
<P>
The parameters <TT>correl_start</TT> and <TT>correl_end</TT> can be
used to switch this option on and off during a multiphase simulation. 

<A NAME="correl">
<P><LI><B>correl</B><P>
</A>
This option enables the computation of the (spherically averaged)
<B>van Hove self-correlation function</B> (VHSCF).
<P>
The computation of the VHSCF is started at step 
<TT>correl_start</TT>, and ends at step <TT>correl_end</TT>. 
Every <TT>correl_int</TT> steps after <TT>correl_start</TT>, 
the correlation histogram is written to files 
<TT>&lt;basename&gt;.corr&lt;n&gt.&lt;i&gt;</TT>,
where <TT>&lt;n&gt;</TT> is a running number and 
<TT>&lt;i&gt;</TT> ist the atom type. Every <TT>correl_ts</TT>
steps, correlation data is added to the histogram.
<P>
The dimension of the correlation histogram is detemined by the
parameters <TT>correl_tmax</TT> (time direction) and 
<TT>correl_rmax</TT> (radial direction). The step width
of the histogram is <TT>correl_ts</TT> in time direction,
and (half) the diagonal of the box, divided by <TT>correl_rmax</TT>,
in radial direction.
<P>
There are several modes for the output format, determined by the
parameter <TT>correl_omode</TT>:
<PRE>
 1  for gnuplot files with 1 empty line between blocks
 2  for gnuplot files with 2 empty lines between blocks
 3  for large gnuplot files (fully occupied matrix) with no empty lines
 4  for short files (refer to source for documentation)
    (writes only a short header followed by matrix elements)
</PRE>
The third mode uses a further parameter, <TT>GS_rcut</TT>, which is
a cutoff radius for the data to be written.
<P>
The parameters <TT>correl_start</TT> and <TT>correl_end</TT> can be
used to switch this option on and off during a multiphase simulation. 
<B>Beware:</B> in the current implementation, the histogram is allocated only
once at the beginning of the simulation, and so the dimensions of the 
histogram must not change during the simulation!

<P>
<B>Known bugs:</B>
<P>
Resetting the reference positions <TT>every correl_int</TT> 
steps is fine, but why do we have to write out and clear the histogram
each time?
<P>
The time in the histogram is taken modulo <TT>correl_tmax</TT>,
but the reference positions are not reset, which spoils the
whole histogram, if <TT>correl_tmax &gt; correl_int</TT>! 
<P>
Why don't we use a radial cutoff of the histogram right away, 
instead of the wiered constuction with the diagonal, which works 
only for orthogonal boxes anyway? In any case, it is better
not to compute the parts of the histogram that are not needed,
instead of just not writing them out (parameter GS_rcut)!

<A NAME="disloc">
<P><LI><B>disloc</B><P>
</A>
The disloc option enables certain features useful to see dislocations.
<P>
If the disloc option is present, reference potential energies are
provided for each particle. A differential potential energy (DE) is
computed from the current and the reference value. Particles with DEs
exceeding a threshold <TT>min_dpot</TT> (default 1.0) are
plotted. This is done for only one type of atoms specified in
<TT>dpotsorte</TT> (default 0).
<P> 
If the parameter
<TT>calc_Epot_ref</TT> is set to 0 (default) the reference potential
energy is read from a file specified in <TT>reffile</TT>. This is a
normal checkpoint file which must contain the same particles at the
same line as the input file. IMD checks the atom number (actually the
absolute value of the atom number, so that fixed atoms are not a
problem). If <TT>calc_Epot_ref</TT> is set to 1, the potential energy
at step <TT>reset_Epot_ref</TT> (default: 0) becomes the reference
potential energy.
<P>
If the disloc option is present and the parameter <TT>Epot_diff</TT>
is 1 (which is the default), the potential energy written to
<A HREF="pictures.html"><TT>.pic</TT> files</A> and to 
<A HREF="output.html#distributions">energy distribution files</A> is 
the difference of the actual potential energy and the reference 
potential energy. This can be switched off by setting
<TT>Epot_diff</TT> to 0.
<P>
The disloc option also enables the writing of 
<A HREF="output.html#disloc">differential energy maps</A> 
in intervals of <TT>dem_int</TT>, 
and of <A HREF="output.html#disloc">differential displacement maps</A> 
in intervals of <TT>ddm_int</TT>.
The parameters needed are described together with the 
<A HREF="output.html#disloc">format of these files</A>.
<P>
The writing of these files can be switched off by setting the 
writing intervals to zero. 
<P>
<B>Known bugs:</B> The reference potential energy can be set
only once in each phase.

<A NAME="homdef">
<P><LI><B> homdef </B><P>
</A>
<P>
The homdef option allows to homogeneously expand or shear the
sample. The box is deformed in this process, together with its
contents. Note that this option requires <B>periodic</B> boundary 
conditions.
<UL>
<P><LI>
If <TT>exp_interval</TT> is positive, the sample is expanded every 
<TT>exp_interval</TT> steps. The expansion factors in x-, y- and
z-direction are given by the parameter <TT>expansion</TT>, which
is a vector. The box vectors are updated automatically, and the
cell subdivision is revised if cells have become too small
(expansion factors smaller than 1 shrink the sample).
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
If <TT>hom_interval</TT> is positive, the sample is homogeneously 
sheared every <TT>hom_interval</TT> steps. In each shear step,
<TT>shear_factor</TT>*x-coord is added to the y-coord of every
particale, and the box is updated accordingly. If cells become too 
small because of the shearing, the cell subdivision is revised 
automatically. It is assumed that the second and third box vector
point into y- and z-direction, respectively.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
If <TT>lindef_interval</TT> is positive, the sample is linear
deformed every <TT>lindef_interval</TT> steps. The linear 
deformation is given as a full deformation matrix <B>A</B> with
row vectors <TT>lindef_x</TT>, <TT>lindef_y</TT>, and <TT>lindef_z</TT>,
if three dimensions are simulated. The transformation rule is
<B>x</B> -> <B>x</B> + <B>A</B> <B>x</B>  for both atomic positions
and box vectors.
</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="deform">
<P><LI><B> deform </B><P>
</A>
<P>
The deform option requires <B>free</B> boundary conditions
(the box won't be deformed, but periodic boundary conditions can be
used, e.g. when the deformation in the is orthogonal to the pbc (use
at own risc, take care of centroid (angular) momentum).
A deform step is performed if either <TT>max_deform_int</TT> is
positive and the last deform step was done <TT>max_deform_int</TT>
steps ago, or if the temperature drops below <TT>ekin_threshold</TT>
(useful with the mik integrator). In a deform step, all atoms of 
virtual type v are shifted by the <TT>deform_shift</TT> vector for 
that type v. A <TT>deform_shift</TT> for type v is specified as
follows in the parameter file:
<PRE>
    deform_shift v shift_vector
</PRE>
During the first <TT>annealsteps</TT> steps, no deformations are
done. This mechanism can be used both for shears (<TT>deform_shift</TT> 
parallel to sample boundary) and for compressions or expansions
(<TT>deform_shift</TT> perpendicular to sample boundary). The
atoms with the virtual types concerned are usually located in two 
boundary layers of the sample.

<A NAME="glokdeform">
<P><LI><B> glokdeform </B><P>
</A>
<P>
Like deform, just with the fnorm criterium, therefore with 
parameter <TT>fnorm_threshold</TT>.

<A NAME="FBC">
<P><LI><B>fbc</B><P>
</A>
Force Boundary Conditions. With this option, one can define extra 
forces that act on atoms of certain <A HREF="general.html#virtual">
virtual types</A>. This is implemented for the nve, nvt and mik
ensembles.
<P> For each concerned virtual type, one can declare in the parameter 
file the starting and the end value (in the simulation phase) of an 
extra force vector that is added to the force acting on atoms of
that virtual type.
The parameters <TT>extra_startforce</TT> and <TT>extra_endforce</TT> 
expect 1 integer and d real numbers, where d is the sample dimension. 
The first integer number specifies the virtual atom type, the other 
d real numbers specify the extra force vector. The values between
<TT>extra_startforce</TT> and <TT>extra_endforce</TT> are linearly
interpolated (like the temperature). 
<P>
For mik simulations, instead of <TT>extra_endforce</TT> the force 
increment <TT>extra_dforce</TT> should be specified. It is added to 
the applied force each time the temperature drops under 
<TT>fbc_ekin_threshold</TT>, or after <TT>fbc_waitsteps</TT>. 
During the initial <TT>fbc_annealsteps</TT> steps, no extra forces 
are applied.
<P>
Note that the parameter <TT>total_types</TT> must be read 
<STRONG>before</STRONG> any extra forces.
</LI>

<A NAME="sock">
<P><LI><B>sock</B><P>
</A>
Provide support for sockets (for visualization).

<A NAME="eam">
<P><LI><B>eam</B><P>
</A>
<a href=eam2.html>Use Embedded Atom Method potentials.</a>

<A NAME="covalent">
<P><LI><B>keating</B>, <B>ttbp</B>, <B>stiweb</B>, and <B>tersoff</B><P>
<A HREF="covalent.html">Use many-body potentials.</A>

<A NAME="ewald">
<P><LI><B>ewald</B><P>
<A HREF="ewald.html">Use Coulomb potential with Ewald summation method.</A>

<A NAME="spring">
<P><LI><B>spring</B><P> Use harmonic potential. The spring constants
<I>k<SUB>ij</SUB></I> are specified by the IMD parameter
<TT>spring_const</TT>. In the parameter file, they have to be given in
a line in the format <I>k<SUB>01</SUB></I> <I>k<SUB>02</SUB></I> ...
<I>k<SUB>0(n-1)</SUB></I> <I>k<SUB>12</SUB></I>
... <I>k<SUB>(n-2)(n-1)</SUB></I> where <I>n</I> is
<TT>ntypes</TT>. All diagonal spring constants <I>k<SUB>ii</SUB></I> are
set equal to zero. The option spring can be used for simulations with
the shell model.


<A NAME="uniax">
<P><LI><B>uniax</B><P>
</A>
<a href=uniax.html>Use Gay-Berne potential for uniaxial molecules.</a>

<A NAME="pacx">
<P><LI><B>pacx</B><P>
</A>
Link with PACX libraries in addition to MPI. 
Needed for Metacomputing, but also useful if certain MPI routines are
not available. 
PACX is an extension of MPI which allows the distribution of the
simulation across a network of (possibly continent-widely) separated
supercomputers. 
<P>
IMD uses MPI_Cart routines to set up the communication network between
the PEs. This is not possible with PACX since one supercomputer sees
only the communication nodes of the other and not its
topology. Therefore the MPI_Cart routines have been replaced.
<P>
The PACX library is available from the PACX-Group at the RUS.
A description of PACX and how to use it can be found <A
HREF="http://www.hlrs.de/people/gabriel/PROJECTS/pacx/pacx.html">here</A>.

<A NAME="shock">
<P><LI><B>shock</B><P>
</A>
It is possible to simulate shockwaves with IMD. A shockwave is
generated in the following way: We use a box which is  periodic
along the y- and z-axis and has free boundaries in the x-direction.
The shockwave is generated by setting the velocities
of the atoms in routine imd_maxwell within a strip
<TT>shock_strip</TT> orthogonal to the x-axis to a constant
value <TT>shock_speed</TT>. The velocity direction is in the positive 
x-axis. 
<P>
There are several modes set by <TT>shock_mode</TT>: <P><UL><LI>If <TT>shock_mode</TT>
is set to 1 then the left part of the sample with thickness
<TT>shock_strip</TT> is slammed into the right
part. <LI>If the parameter is set to 2 then two halves of the sample are
slammed into oneanother. <LI>If the parameter is set to 3 then the
whole sample is slammed into a fixed wall.</UL>
<P>
<B>Important</B>: Currently, the atom velocities for the shockwave
are set by the routine imd_maxwell, which is called at the start
of the simulation only. It is therefore not possible to start
a shockwave in a later phase of a multiphase simulation. 
Therefore, this option is <A HREF="limitations.html">not multiphase 
ready</A>.

<A NAME="transport">
<P><LI><B>transport</B><P>
</A>
This option enables IMD to compute the heat conductivty of a
sample. It is automatically activated by the
<A HREF="ensembles.html#nvx">nvx ensemble</A>.
The sample is divided into <TT>tran_nlayers</TT> layers.
The temperature of layer 0 is initialized to 
<TT>starttemp + dTemp_start</TT>, and linearly moved to 
<TT>starttemp + dTemp_end</TT> during the simulation. Similarly, 
the temperature of layer <TT>tran_nlayers/2</TT> (in the middle of 
the sample) is initially set to <TT>starttemp - dTemp_start</TT>,
and linearly moved to <TT>starttemp - dTemp_end</TT>.
The time, the heat conductivity, and the temperatures in
layers 0 to <TT>tran_nlayers/2</TT> is written to the
file <TT>&lt;basename&gt;.tempdist</TT> every
<tt>tran_interval</tt> steps.

<A NAME="stress_tens">
<P><LI><B>stress</B><P>
</A>
This option enables imd to compute the stress or pressure tensor. 
The result will be written as a histogram into a file 
<TT>&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.pressdist</TT>. The output
file further contains the density, kinetic energy and potential 
energy distribution. The writing interval is given by the parameter 
<tt>press_interval</tt>, the dimension of the histogram by the
integer vector <tt>press_dim</TT>. 
<P>
In <B>shock</B> mode, only the diagonal part of the pressure
tensor is written. Further, the histogram is written as a function 
of the x-coordinate only, and averaged over the y- and z-coordinate 
(in 3d). For that purpose, the second and third component of
<tt>press_dim</TT> have to be set to 1. 

<A NAME="fnorm">
<P><LI><B> fnorm </B><P>
Writes the average of the modulus of a (random) force component to 
the <TT>.eng</TT> file. This should be a good measure for the degree 
of relaxation in a glok or mik simulation. 

<A NAME="einstein">
<P><LI><B> einstein </B><P>
Writes the Einstein frequency to the <TT>.eng</TT> file. This value 
can be used as <TT>inv_tau_eta</TT> for a Nose-Hoover thermostat.
This option is supported in NVE, NVT and NPT simulations only.

<A NAME="efilter">
<P><LI><B> efilter </B><P>
Only those atoms which have a potential energy between e_pot_lower and
e_pot_upper are writen in <TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.ef.&lt;n&gt;</TT>,
where <TT>&lt;n&gt;</TT> is a running number. This happens every
ef_checkpt_int steps.

<A NAME="snap">
<P><LI><B> snap </B><P>
Option to write snapshots of atomic configurations and the
corresponding informations in 
<TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.n.&lt;ss&gt;</TT>,
<TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.n.&lt;ssitr&gt;</TT> and 
<TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.eng</TT> when a certain condition is fullfilled. 
At the moment only used by the option glokdeform.


<A NAME="writef">
<P><LI><B> writef </B><P>
Writes the forces on atoms of virtual types into  
<TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.wf.&lt;n&gt;</TT>,
where <TT>&lt;n&gt;</TT> is a running number. This happens at the moment 
only in combination with snap.


<A NAME="avpos">
<P><LI><B> avpos </B><P> This option enables IMD to compute the
average position of the atoms during a time interval. The averaging
begins at step <TT>avpos_start</TT> (default 0) and ends at step
<TT>avpos_end</TT> (default <TT>maxsteps</TT>). Every
<TT>avpos_int</TT> steps, the averaged positions are written in an
output file <TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.avp</TT>. The output file
further contains the average potential energy of the atoms. After
writing the output, the averaging begins with the actual atom
positions. The number of steps between additions of coordinates is
specified by the parameter <TT>avpos_res</TT>. For each avpos output
file, an avpos iteration file is written which has the name
<TT>&lt;outfile&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.avp.itr</TT> and contains the actual box
vectors. When an NPT ensemble is used, the averaged box vectors are
written in this file.

<A NAME="quasi">
<P><LI><B>quasi</B><P>
</A>
This option is required for the generation of truncated icosahedra
quasicrystals, one of the few structure types IMD can
<A HREF="config.html#generated">generate itself</A>.

<A NAME="ordpar">
<P><LI><B>ordpar</B><P>
</A>
Order parameter closely related to the potential energy. In
quasicrystals the potential energy of atoms of the same type can be
quite different, depending on their neighbourhood, so that defects
can be hard to detect. The order parameter - which is printed in the
output files instead of the potential energy - narrows the potential
energy distribution and improves the visibility of defects.
<P>
Only atoms within a sphere of a certain radius  which is specified in
the ntypes<SUP>2</SUP>-dimensional vector <TT>op_rcut</TT> contribute 
to the order parameter: their potential energy, weighted by the number
specified in the ntypes<SUP>2</SUP>-dimensional vector <TT>op_weight</TT>
is summed up.
<P>
For two-dimensional binary tiling quasicrystals in the ground state, 
the numbers of neighbors of the different types obey a linear
relation. With the choice
<PRE>
   op_rcut    1.50 1.25 1.25 0.85
   op_weight  1.00 0.25 0.50 1.00
</PRE>
all atoms will then have the same value of the order parameter.
<P>
In three dimensions no such simple relation can be found. Here the
order parameter is in addition divided by the total number of 
neighbours. This has proven useful for the detection of dislocations 
and stacking faults. The number of neighbours is also being printed 
in the configuration file.

<A NAME="monolj">
<P><LI><B>monolj</B><P>
</A>
Monoatomic Lennard-Jones system. The masses are all set to 1, and
particles have no number. All this saves space, which is useful for 
world records. 
<P>
<B>Editor's remark:</B> Part of this could also be achieved by
using only one mass variable per atom type, instead of one per atom.

<A NAME="mono, binary">
<P><LI><B>mono, binary</B><P>
</A>
The hard coding of the number of different atom types speeds up imd.
Caution: do not use mono when using different atomtypes... 

<A NAME="single">
<P><LI><B>single</B><P>
</A>
Do everything with single precision (default is double precision).
This saves space, which is useful for world records.

<A NAME="4point">
<P><LI><B>4point</B><P>
</A>
Imd uses by default a 3-point Lagrange interpolation to determine the 
interaction energy and the forces. This option switches to a 4-point
Lagrange interpolation.

<A NAME="hpo">
<P><LI><B>hpo</B><P>
</A>
The output is writen with a higher precision.

<A NAME="debug">
<P><LI><B>debug</B><P>
</A>
Compile with debug flags.

<A NAME="timing">
<P><LI><B>timing</B><P>
</A>
This option gives an idea how much time is spent in IO  

<A NAME="prof">
<P><LI><B>prof</B><P>

Compile with profiling support.

<A NAME="epitax">
<P><LI><B>epitax</B><P>
</A>
This option enables the simulation of vacuum deposition of atoms. 
For more details take a look at the description of the 
<A HREF="epitax.html">EPITAX implementation</A>.

<A NAME="EPOT_DIFF">
<P><LI><B>EPOT_DIFF</B><P>

The EPOT_DIFF flags has been eliminated. Its functionality has been
built into the option <A HREF="#disloc">disloc</A>.

<A NAME="ZOOM">
<P><LI><B>ZOOM</B><P>
</A>
If set, only partial configurations consisting of the atoms inside the
frame defined by <A HREF="pictures.html"><TT>pic_ll</TT> and

<A HREF="pictures.html"><TT>.pic</TT></A> files to make partial 
pictures, though. ZOOM is available only in 2d at present. 

<A NAME="PAXTEST">
