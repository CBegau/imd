<h1>Parameters</h1>

<p>
IMD reads all simulation parameters from the parameter file,
which is specified on the command line. In the case of a 
<a href="#multiphase">multiphase simulation</a>, the parameter
file contains the entire script describing the the simulation.</p>

<p>
Each line in the parameter file contains one parameter, first its
name, then its value (or values), separated by spaces or tabs. 
Empty lines are discarded, as is everything after a # character.</p>

<p>
Certain parameters are required for every simulation, such as the
simulation ensemble, the file with the starting configuration, 
the box size, the number of steps to be simulated, etc. 
IMD makes a rudimentary check whether every parameter needed is 
actually given.</p>

<p>
Other parameters make sense only in a certain context. If a parameter
appears in the parameter file, but is not needed in the current
context, a warning is issued, and the parameter is ignored.</p>

<h2>Valid Parameters</h2>

<p>
There is a list of all <a href="params.html">valid parameters</a>,
where each parameter is given with a short description of its meaning,
and when it is needed. For the meaning of more specialized parameters,
the description of the corresponding <a href="ensembles.html">ensembles</a>
and <a href="options.html">options</a> should be consulted.</p>

Multiphase Simulations</a></h2>

<p>
An IMD simulation can consist of several phases. Many parameters,
in particular the MD integrator to be used, can change from one
phase to the next. Simulation phases are numbered consecutively,
from 1 to N. The parameter file contains first the parameters for
phase 1, then the parameters for phase 2, etc. The start of the
parameter file section for phase n is announced with a line
<pre>
simulation n
</pre>
Announcing the parameters for the first phase is optional. Before
phase n is started, the parameters of all phases up to n are
(re-)read. If a certain parameter is not given afresh for the new
phase, its value from the previous phase (or its default value)
is retained. In other words, only paramters whose values have changed
need be given for the later phases.</p>

<p>
Certain parameters <b>must not be changed</b> during the simulation, 
like the box size. Also, it is probably a good idea to take care that 
the external temperature and pressure are continuous throughout the 
simulation. It is the <b>user's responsibility</b> that the parameter
starttemp is equal to the parameter endtemp of the previous phase. 
A similar statement holds for the external pressure.</p>

<p>
Example of a paramter file with 4 phases:
<pre>
simulation      1     # this line is not really needed
ensemble        nvt   # nvt ensemble
maxsteps        1000  # phase stops at step 1000
starttemp       0.1   # starting temperature
endtemp         0.1   # ending temperature - temperature remains constant

other parameters for phase 1 (and the other phases)

simulation      2
maxsteps        2000  # phase stops at step 2000
starttemp       0.1   # not needed - does not change
endtemp         0.5   # ending temperature - temperature increases linearly

simulation      3
maxsteps        3000  # phase stops at step 3000
starttemp       0.5   # this IS needed - temperature should be continuous
endtemp         0.5   # not needed

simulation      4
maxsteps        4000  # phase stops at step 4000
ensemble	nve   # we continue with nve ensemble
</pre>
All four phases last 1000 steps. The first three use the nvt ensemble,
the last one the nve ensemble. In the second phase, the system is 
heated linearly from temperature 0.1 to temperature 0.5. Note that
the parameter maxsteps is the step number at which the simulation
phase ends, not the number of steps in the simulation phase.</p>
