<H1>Valid IMD Parameters</H1>

Following is a complete list of IMD parameters, together with a short
description of their meaning, and indications when they are needed.
Floating point numbers should be given in decimal notation. Vectors
are given as a list of components, separated by spaces or tabs (all 
on one line).

<PRE>
# file names - required
coordname	# file name for atom coordinate input data
outfiles	# basename for output files - use a name different from
                # input file name, otherwise it will be overwritten
potfile		# filename for pair potential data

# main control parameters - required (except startstep)
simulation      # number of next simulation phase, whose parameters follow
ensemble        # simulation ensemble (MD integrator) 
maxsteps	# step number at which simulation phase ends
startstep       # starting step number (default 0)
timestep	# size of timestep (in MD units)
ntypes		# number of atom types (types vary in [0..ntypes-1])

# control parameters for parallel simulation
cpu_dim		# CPU array dimension - required if parallel
parallel_input  # parallel input (1, default, recommended) or serial (0) input
parallel_output	# parallel output flag (0 == serial (default),
                # 1 == parallel, 2 == serial, but parallel picture writes)

# simulation box - required
box_x		# 'x' or first vector for box
box_y		# 'y' or second vector for box
box_z		# 'z' or third vector for box - only 3D

# intervals for data writes - default is 0
checkpt_int	# number of steps between checkpoints
eng_int		# number of steps between energy data writes
pic_int		# number of steps between picture writes

# peierls - nabarro dislocations
pn              # if (1) : construct a pn dislocation
burgersv	# length of Burgers vector (pointing in x direction)
width           # width of Burgers vector density
glideplane      # z-coordinate of glideplane (in two dimensions: y)

# temperature, pressure, and related stuff
# required if ensemble supports temperature or pressure control
# in other ensembles, starttemp might be needed to initialize the velocities
starttemp	     # Temperature at start of simulation phase. Also used to 
                     # initialize the velocities, if these are not given.
use_current_temp     # (without arguments) Instructs IMD to set the starting
                     # external temperature to the actual system temperature.
                     # In this case, the velocities MUST be given.
endtemp		     # Temperature at end of simulation phase.
                     # If different from starttemp, and ensemble can
		     # control the temperature, the temperature varies
                     # linearly during the simulation phase
tempintv	     # time interval for Anderson thermostat
pressure_start	     # external starting pressure/stress for NPT
use_current_pressure # (without arguments) Similar to use_current_temp.
                     # Instructs IMD to use the current system pressure
                     # as the starting external pressure.
pressure_end	     # external end pressure/stress for NPT
                     # if different from pressure_start, the pressure
		     # varies linearly during the simulation
tau_eta		     # time constant for thermostat
tau_xi		     # time constant for volume control in NPT simulation
isq_tau_eta	     # 1/SQR(tau_eta). Can be zero, which corresponds to NVE

                     # to NVT or NVE

                     # NPT simulation
