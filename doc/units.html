<h1>Units</h1>

<p>
IMD does not need a particular system of units. It can work with any
system. The units used by IMD are implicitly defined in the configuration
and potential files, and possibly by certain parameters specifying
the potential. The configuration file contains atom positions and
atom masses, which implicitly defines a length unit and a mass unit,
respectively. The interaction potential implicitly makes use of a 
length unit and an energy unit. Of course, this length unit must be the 
same as for the configuration file. The three units of length, mass, and
energy determine all other units, which are derived from them.
The temperature is always given in energy units.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
If the length unit is 1&nbsp;Angstrom = 1e-10&nbsp;m, the energy unit
1&nbsp;eV = 1.6022e-19&nbsp;J (which corresponds to 11605&nbsp;K), and 
the mass unit is 1&nbsp;amu = 1.6605e-27&nbsp;kg, we have for the unit 
of time 1.018e-14&nbsp;s = 10.18&nbsp;fs. The unit of pressure then 
is 160.2&nbsp;GPa = 1602&nbsp;kbar.</p> 

<h3><a id="timestep" name="timestep">Time step</h3>

<p>
For simulating a solid, a time step of 1 femtosecond is usually a
good starting point. Whether a certain time step is a reasonable
choice can be checked by making an NVE simulation for some 10000
time steps, with <tt>eng_int</tt> set to 1 (writing the energy at
every time step). The resulting .eng file can then be Fourier
transformed with the utility program <a href="util_misc.html#imd_power">
imd_power</a>, revealing the frequency spectrum of the fluctuations of
the kinetic energy and other quantities. If the mode with the highest 
essential frequency omega_max in that spectrum shall be tracked with, 
say, 30 time steps, then the time step must be roughly equal to
2*pi/(30*omega_max). If the initial time step was too small, this 
procedure should be repeated.

<h3><a id="temp_control" name="temp_control">
Time constant for temperature control</h3>

<p>
The <a href="ensembles.html#ensembles">integrators</a> nvt, npt_iso, 
and npt_axial offer a Nose-Hoover thermostat, which requires a time 
constant <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt> to be set appropriately. This time 
constant defines another frequency in the system; in order for the 
thermostat to work well, it must couple effectively to the native 
freqency spectrum of the system. A good estimate for a suitable 
value of <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt> can be obtained in an 
<a href="ensembles.html#ensembles">NVE simulation</a> with the compile 
option <a href="options.html#einstein">einstein</a> switched on. 
The Einstein frequency is then written to the <tt>.eng</tt> file,
whose average (or two thirds thereof) can be used as an initial
value of <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>. With that value, an 
<a href="ensembles.html#ensembles">NVT simulation</a>
should then be performed, and the frequency spectrum analysed with
the utility program <a href="util_misc.html#imd_power">imd_power</a>.
With a bad choice of <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>, an extra peak outside
the native frequency spectrum is visible, whose position is
proportional to <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>, which can then be corrected
accordingly. For a good choice of <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>, the frequency
spectrum is only slighly distorted. The optimal value of 
<tt>inv_tau_eta</tt> is usually not very critical, and changes only
slowly with temperature and pressure.</p>

<h3><a id="press_control" name="press_control">
Time constant for pressure control</h3>

<p>
Besides a time constant for temperature control (which should be
determined first and then kept fixed), the 
<a href="ensembles.html#ensembles">ensembles</a> npt_iso and 
npt_axial also require a time constant for pressure
control, <tt>inv_tau_xi</tt>. Its determination is analoguous
to the determination of <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>, except that here
one looks at pressure fluctuations. Also, there is no analogue
of the Einstein frequency as initial guess, so that some 
experimentation is necessary. One usually obtains a very large 
and sharp peak in the fluctuation spectrum, which suggests how 
to change <tt>inv_tau_xi</tt>. It is in fact not so easy to find 
a value for which there is no large extra peak in the spectrum. 
The value of <tt>inv_tau_xi</tt> needs to be determined much 
more precisely than <tt>inv_tau_eta</tt>. </p>
