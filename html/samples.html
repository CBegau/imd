<H1>Making Samples</H1>

In the directory <B>imd-samples</B>, there are several subdirectories
for different kinds of structures. For each of these, these
directories should eventually contain sample configurations, 
programs to make such sample configurations, sample parameter 
files, sample output files, etc.
<P>
At present, there are programs to make sample configurations for
the following structures:
<UL>
<LI> <B>alcuco</B>
<P> 
Periodic approximants of the Zeger model of decagonal AlCuCo quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="../imd-samples/alcuco/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>bin2d</B>
<P>
Periodic approximants of 2d binary tiling quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="../imd-samples/bin2d/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>ibt3d</B> (also known as <B>tiqc</B>)
<P>
Periodic approximants of icosahedral binary tiling quasicrystals,
also known as trucated icosahedra quasicrystals.
There is a <A HREF="../imd-samples/ibt3d/README">description</A> how
to make such approximants.
<P> 
<LI><B>fcc</B>
<P>
FCC crystals. The program imd_make_fcc.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac, pull or shear simulations).
<P> 
<LI><B>nacl</B>
<P>
NaCl crystals. The program imd_make_fcc.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac, pull or shear simulations).
<P> 
<LI><B>hex</B>
<P>
Hexagonal crystals. The program imd_make_hex.c asks for the output file, 
the box size, and whether to leave empty a boundary strip 
(for frac, pull or shear simulations).
