<H1>IMD File Headers</H1>

Data files created by IMD contain a header if the flag
<TT>use_header</TT> is set to one. This header is used by several data
processing programs that get information about the data from it or by
the user who can read about the content of each column.  The header
consists of several lines starting with a <TT>#</TT> so that they
still can be read by IMD or gnuplot. A number immediately follows the
<TT>#</TT> so that the application of a sort command to the file will
not change the order of the header lines (otherwise <TT># contents
...</TT> would be put in front of TT># format ...</TT>). They contain
various information about the data in the file. The header of both
atom and distribution files starts with the following line
<PRE>
# format &lt;format&gt;
</PRE>

where "format" is the name of the header line and format consists of
several letters or numbers specifying type, format and ordering of the
data that follows. A second line which serves as a reminder for the
user contains a description of all columns and looks like
<PRE>
# contents &lt;contents&gt;
</PRE>

Further lines are not common to atom and distribution files. They
contain useful information like box parameters or histogram
dimensions. The last lines in both cases marks the end of the header
and are
<PRE>
# Generated by &lt;program name&gt; on &lt;date&gt;
# endheader
</PRE>

Now the lines containing the data follow.


<H4>Atom files headers</H4>

The format line is
<PRE>
# format T F n t m c v d
</PRE>
where T and F are letters and the other values are numbers:

<UL>
<LI>T: a for atoms</LI>
<LI>F: A for ASCII, B for binary big endian, L for binary little endian</LI>
<LI>n: number of columns for the atom number (0 or 1)</LI>
<LI>t: number of columns for the atom type (0 or 1)</LI>
<LI>m: number of columns for the mass (0 or 1)</LI>
<LI>c: number of columns for the atom coordinates (2 or 3)</LI>
<LI>v: number of columns for the atom velocities (0, 2 or 3)</LI>
<LI>d: number of columns for the atom data, i. e. Epot (0, 1,...)</LI>
</UL>

The contents line is something like
<PRE>
# contents  number type mass x y z vx vy vz Epot
</PRE>
Then follow three lines containing the box parameters:
<PRE>
# box_x   boxx.x boxx.y boxx.z
# box_y   boxy.x boxy.y boxy.z
# box_z   boxz.x boxz.y boxz.z
</PRE>
In two dimensions the contents line would lack z and vz and only two
lines for the box parameters would be necessary. Finally comes
<PRE>

# endheader
</PRE>
Example
<PRE>
# format    a A 1 1 1 3 3 1
# contents  number type mass x y z vx vy vz Epot
# box_z     20 0 0
# box_z     0 20 0
# box_z     0 0 20
# Generated by imd_nve_risc_3d on Fri Oct 11 15:05:54 1583
# endheader
</PRE>
<H4>Distribution files headers</H4>

The format line is
<PRE>
# format T F c d
</PRE>
and T and F are letters and the other values are numbers:

<UL>
<LI>T: d for distributions</LI>
<LI>F: A for ASCII, B for binary big endian, L for binary little endian</LI>
<LI>c: number of columns for the bin coordinates (0, 2 or 3)</LI>
<LI>d: number of columns for the atom data, i. e. Epot (1,...)</LI>
</UL>

The contents line is 
<PRE>
# contents  x y z Ekin
</PRE>
or, in most cases
<PRE>
# contents  Ekin
</PRE>
depending whether the bin coordinates are present or not in the data.
Then follows a line specifying the "dimension" of the data:
<PRE>
# dim d x y z
</PRE>
d is the dimension of the sample (2 or 3) and x, y, z are the
histogram dimensions. If d==2 z must not be present. The last line is
<PRE>
# Generated by imd_nve_risc_3d on Fri Oct 11 15:05:54 1583
# endheader
</PRE>
Example
<PRE>
# format    d A 0 1
# contents  Epot
# dim	    2 20 15
# Generated by imd_nve_risc_2d on Fri Oct 11 15:05:54 1583
# endheader
</PRE>
