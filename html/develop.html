<H1>Developer's Corner</H1>

Here we give some hints on how to extend IMD. In particular, we list
some common pitfalls that are to be avoided.

<H2>Naming conventions for files</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Source files are all named with lower case letters
<LI> Dimension specific files have the dimension in their name
  (e.g. imd_geom_2d.c)
<LI> Names for architecture specific files contain the architecture in
  their name (e.g. imd_main_risc.c, imd_main_mpi.c)
<LI> Non-source files in the source directory begin with a capital letter
  (e.g. Makefile, README, INSTALL)
<LI> Documentation files should be written in English and in HTML
(preferably) or LaTeX.
</UL>

<H2>Introducing new parameters</H2>

Before a new parameter can be used, it must be
<UL>
<LI>declared and initialized to default value (in file globals.h)
<LI>read into IMD (routine getparamfile() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>possibly checked for nonsense values (routine
    check_parameters_complete() in file imd_param.c)
<LI>broadcast to the other CPUs (routine broadcast_params() in
    file imd_param.c)
</UL>

<H2>Extending the particle data structure</H2>

Each particle in IMD carries a number of data items with it.
If a is particle moved to a different cell, or even a different
CPU, these data must be moved as well. They always remain with
the particle.
<P>
In order to extend the particle data structure, the following
must be done:
<UL>
<LI> the declaration of the type <TT>cell</TT> must be extended
     with the new data item (in file types.h)</LI>
<LI> the allocation routine alloc_cell() for the particle data
     must be extended (file imd_alloc.c)</LI>
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle 
     from one cell to another cell within the same CPU, the routine
     move_atom() in file imd_alloc.c must be extended</LI>
<LI> in order that the particle data move together with the particle
     from one CPU to another CPU,
     the routines copy_one_atom() und process_buffer() in file
     imd_mpi_util.c must be extended. These routines pack/unpack 
     selected atoms with their data into/from a communications buffer.
<LI> If the force computation requires further data besides the atom 
     types and positions (like the direction of a non-pointlike
     particle), these must be sent to the buffer cells.
     For this purpose, the routines copy_cell, pack_cell and
     unpack_cell in files imd_comm_force_2d.c and imd_comm_force_3d.c 
     must be extended. These routines move the atom data needed for 
     the force computation from cells to communication buffers,
     from communication buffers to buffer cells, or directly
     from cells to buffer cells, if these are on the same CPU. 
     The size of the communication buffers computed in
     setup_buffers() in file imd_mpi_util.c must be adjusted.
     </LI>
<LI> If AR is defined, the forces in the buffer cells must be added 
     to the forces in the corresponding original cells. Besides
     the usual forces, this concerns also generalized forces like
     momenta in the case of non-isotropic molecules, and all
     quantities that are computed in do_forces and depend on 
     a particle and its neighbors, like, e.g., the stress tensor.
     These properties are added back to the original cells with
     the routines add_forces, pack_forces, and unpack_forces 
     in files imd_comm_force_2d.c and imd_comm_force_3d.c, which 
     must be extended. In order to avoid this complication, 
     one can switch to the non-AR case by undefining the preprocessor 
     symbol AR in config.h. The size of the communication buffers as
     computed in setup_buffers() in file imd_mpi_util.c must be adjusted.
</UL>

Examples for such extensions of the particle data structure can
be found by looking for the preprocessor flags REFPOS or DISLOC
in the files mentioned.

<H2>Revision Control System: CVS</H2>

Starting with IMD 1.2 we are managing IMD with the CVS software
maintenance system. A description of the basic commands can be found
in the <A HREF="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/page2/itapsoft/simulation/imd-doc/">imd-doc</A> directory.

To simplify the version control with CVS each developer is urged to
include the following lines of comment at the beginning of each new source
code file:
<P>

/****************************************************************<BR>
* $Revision$<BR>
* $Date$<BR>
*****************************************************************/<BR>
<P>
CVS replaces these lines automatically with the correct
version numbers, if the new file is checked into the CVS repository.
