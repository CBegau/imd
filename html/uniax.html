<h1>Gay-Berne Potential (option uniax)</h1>

<p>
The Gay-Berne potential models the pair interaction 
of uniaxial molecules. It depends not only on the scalar
distance of their centres of mass but also on their
mutual orientation. Due to this complicated dependence
the Gay-Berne interaction cannot be tabulated. In IMD
it is calculated from its analytical expression. Forces
and torques are also evaluated analytically as 
derivatives of the potential.</p>

<h2>Gay-Berne model</h2>

<p>
The Gay-Berne potential for uniaxial molecules (UNIAX) was implemented
by Joachim Stelzer. It is a model for the pair interaction of two 
axially symmetric ellipsoidal molecules. The original model was
invented by J. G. Gay and B. J. Berne <em>J. Chem. Phys.</em> 
<b>74</b>, 3316 (1981). </p>

<h2>Molecular Properties</h2>

<p>
In conventional IMD an atom is completely described by its mass m
and the vectors [rx ry rz] and [vx vy vz] which denote its
position and orientation, respectively. For uniaxial molecules
the data structure is enlarged. Each translational quantity
is supplemented by a rotational one. </p>

<ul>
<li>
  The molecule possesses both mass m and moment of inertia I.</li>
<li>
  Its centre of mass is located at [rx ry rz] and the
  orientation of its main axis is given by a unit vector
  [ux, uy, uz], with ux^2 + uy^2+ uz^2 = 1.</li>
<li>
  Its velocity is [vx vy vz] and its angular velocity is
  [wx wy wz].</li>
<li>
  The total force exerted on the molecule under consideration
  is [fx fy fz]. In addition the rotational state of the 
  molecule is changed due to the torque [tx ty tz].</li>
<li> 
  The shape of the uniaxial molecule is given by the lengths
  of its principal axes [sx sy sz]. Thereby, sx must be equal to
  sy. The original version of the Gay-Berne model deals with
  ellipsoids that possess a shape of sx : sy : sz = 1 : 1 : 3.
  However, the current implementation in IMD allows for 
  arbitrary values of sx and sz.</li>
<li> 
  The anisotropy of the interaction energy is given by the
  well depths of the potential [ex ey ez]. They measure the
  interaction of a pair of molecules whose main axes are
  mutually parallel along the z direction. The three values
  then correspond to the intermolecular separation vector
  pointing along the x y z direction, respectively.
  For uniaxial molecules ex must be equal to ey.
  The original version of the Gay-Berne model deals with
  an energy anisotropy of ex : ey : ez = 1 : 1 : 1/5.
  However, the current implementation in IMD allows for 
  arbitrary values of ex and ez.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Limitation</b>: The current implementation is limited to a 
<b>single type</b> of Gay-Berne particle. </p>

<h2>Gay-Berne Potential</h2>

<p>
For fixed shape and energy anisotropy of the unaxial ellipsoidal
molecules the Gay-Berne pair potential is depending on four quantities:
the scalar separation r<sub>ij</sub> of the centres of mass, the two
angles theta<sub>i</sub> and theta<sub>j</sub> between the molecular 
separation vector
and the main axis of molecule i and j, respectively, and, finally,
the angle phi<sub>ij</sub> for a twist of the molecular axes out of plane.
</p>

<p>
Due to this complicated dependence the Gay-Berne potential cannot
be tabulated. Instead it is calculated from its analytical expressions.
Likewise, the forces and torques are evaluated analytically as
derivatives of the potential. </p>

<h2>Integrators for Uniaxial Molecules</h2>

<p>
Newton's equations of motion govern the time development of the
translational degrees of freedom of the molecules. Uniaxial molecules
in addition possess rotational degrees of freedom (main axis, angular
velocity). These quantities change according to a simplified version
of Euler's gyroid equations. Therefore the integration algorithms
implemented in IMD must be supplemented. This has been performed
for the ensembles with the option NVE, NVT, and NPT_ISO.</p>

<p>
Due to the constraint of the main axis [ux uy uz] being a unit
vector, the integration of the gyroid equations is more complicated
than only a one-to-one mapping of the corresponding way for solving
Newton's equations. In particular, the angular velocity has always
to be perpendicular to the main axis, because a uniaxial molecule
cannot rotate around its main axis. The number of its rotational
degree of freedoms is only two.</p>

<p>
The Nos&eacute;-Hoover thermostat has been supplemented by an analogous
method that keeps the total rotational energy on average at the
value of 2/2 * kT, according to the equipartition theorem. </p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>
No potential table is necessary for the Gay-Berne interaction,
because the potential, forces and torques are calculated analytically.
However, further parametres are required in the IMD input file. </p>

<h2>Compiling IMD for UNIAX</h2>

<p>
When compiling IMD for UNIAX, the option <b>uniax</b> has to
be specified, which is implemented only in three dimensions. 
Only the NVE, NVT, and NPT_ISO ensembles are available, both 
in the serial and the parallel version. Examples: </p>

<pre>
   gmake imd_nve_uniax
   gmake imd_mpi_nvt_uniax
</pre>

<h2>Generating Initial Configurations</h2>

<p>
A separate code (in c) is provided in the IMD user directory:
<b>/imd/imd-samples/uniax/init_conf_uniax.c</b>. It should be
run in interactive mode. Input quantities are requested
from the keyboard. Its output is a IMD configuration file
for uniaxial molecules. <P>
A sample both for a configuration file <b>config.inp</b> and
for a parametre file <b>param.inp</b> is available
in the same directory.
