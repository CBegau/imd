<h1>Simulation of Vacuum Deposition of Atoms</h1>

<p>
The option <b>epitax</b> enables the simulation of vacuum
deposition of atoms on a substrate. During the simulation, a
particle beam is created in the negative z direction (negative y
direction in 2d) as shown in the figure. A substrate can be given
as an atom input file. The default boundary conditions are periodic
boundary conditions in the x and y direction (x direction in 2d)
and free boundary conditions in z direction (y direction in 2d). </p>

<p>The creation of beam atoms begins at <tt>epitax_startstep</tt>
(Default 0) and ends at <tt>epitax_maxsteps</tt>. The data for the
atoms to be created must be given in the following form. The IMD
parameter <tt>epitax_type</tt> contains the types of the atoms in a
row. The masses of the atoms correspond to the parameter
<tt>epitax_mass</tt> and have to be specified in a row
corresponding to the atom types. The rate of creation (in time
steps) of the atoms must be given in a row with the IMD parameter
<tt>epitax_rate</tt>. The velocity of the atoms can be prescribed
for each type as the corresponding temperature with the IMD
parameter <tt>epitax_temp</tt>.</p>

<p>At <tt>epitax_startstep</tt> the atoms are created at the height
given by the IMD paramter <tt>epitax_height</tt>. The x and y
coordinate (x coordinate in 2d) are chosen randomly. However, the
position is chosen in such a way that there is a distance larger
than <tt>epitax_cutoff</tt> between the beam atoms. During the
simulation, the height of creation of particles is moved upwards
with a velocity corresponding to the IMD parameter
<tt>epitax_speed</tt>.</p>

<p>Atoms in the beam are always integrated in the NVE ensemble,
that is, their energy is conserved. The atoms in the substrate are
in the ensemble specified by the IMD parameter <tt>ensemble</tt> as
usual. Atoms that are deposited on the substrate are integrated
with the substrate ensemble where the change of ensemble is
performed as follows. At the beginning of the simulation, the mean
potential energy <i>Epot_mean</i> of the atoms in the substrate is
computed. The potential energy of the beam atoms initially being
zero, the change of ensemble occurs if the potential energy of the
beam atoms falls below <i>C * Epot_mean</i> where the control
parameter <i>C</i> can be prescribed by the IMD parameter
<tt>epitax_ctrl</tt> (Default 1).</p>

<p>Beam atoms that bounce off the substrate or atoms ablated from
the substrate are removed from the simulation cell when they reach
the top array of cells in the IMD cell decomposition (trap cells in
the figure).</p>

<p>During the simulation, the atom number and the coordinates of
the created atoms as well as the atom number and the z coordinates
of the deleted atoms are given in the standard output.</p>
