<H1>Introduction to IMD 1.0 (by J&#246;rg Stadler)</H1>

IMD is a software package to perform classical molecular
dynamics simulations.  As such, it iteratively solves Hamilton's
equations of motion for a system point of masses for some time
interval.  The masses interact via spherically symmetric pair
potentials <I>V</I><SUB><I>ab</I></SUB>(<I>r</I>).  
Each particle belongs to one of various
types, which differ in mass and interaction potential. The
calculations can be carried out under number of thermodynamical and
mechanical boundary conditions, like, for example, constant
temperature, constant pressure or external stress. The form <I>V</I>(<I>r</I>)
of the potenital is read from a table and is therfore not limited to
simple analytical expressions. The number of particle types in a
simulation as well as the number of particles itself is only limited
by the computer resources available.
<P>
The package's main design goals were to create a flexible and
modular software, that reaches a high performance on contemporary
computer architectures, while it is still as portable as
reasonably possible.
IMDs target platforms are RISC workstations and parallel computers,
it does not perform well on vector machines.  It is written in ANSI
C, and uses the widely available MPI library for message passing.
<P>
To perform a simulation, a user first creates the initial
configuration of the particles (i.e. she specifies their positions,
optionally, their velocities at time <I>t</I>=0) and their interaction
potential. Both is done by setting up input files in a simple
format. Then she selects the thermodynamical ensemble and boundary
conditions, specifies additonal applicable parameters and starts the
program. IMD then integrates the systems equation of motion stepwise
and periodically writes thermodynamical properties and particle
configurations to disk.
<P>
This document discusses the usage and the implementation of the IMD
package in detail. The physical foundations and applications of the
molecular dynamics method are adressed only briefly. Performance
numbers for some examples are also given. Finally, some support
programs for input file generation and data analyis are described.
<P>
IMD was developed as subproject A2 of the Sonderforschungsbereich 382
&quot;Verfahren und Algorithmen zur Simulation physikalischer Prozesse auf
Hochleistungsrechnern&quot;. The author wishes to thank SFB 382
for the kind support.
