<H1> Simulation of Vacuum Deposition of Atoms </H1>

The option <B>epitax</B> enables the simulation of vacuum deposition of atoms
on a substrate. During the simulation, a particle beam is created in
the negative z direction (negative y direction in 2d) as shown in the
figure. A substrate can be given as an atom input file. The default
boundary conditions are periodic boundary conditions in the x and y
direction (x direction in 2d) and free boundary conditions in z
direction (y direction in 2d).

The creation of beam atoms begins at <TT>epitax_startstep</TT>
(Default 0) and ends at <TT>epitax_maxsteps</TT>. The data for the
atoms to be created must be given in the following form. The IMD
parameter <TT>epitax_type</TT> contains the types of the atoms in a
row. The masses of the atoms correspond to the parameter
<TT>epitax_mass</TT> and have to be specified in a row corresponding to
the atom types. The rate of creation (in time steps) of the atoms must
be given in a row with the IMD parameter <TT>epitax_rate</TT>. The
velocity of the atoms can be prescribed for each type as the
corresponding temperature with the IMD parameter <TT>epitax_temp</TT>.

<P>

At <TT>epitax_startstep</TT> the atoms are created at the height
given by the IMD paramter <TT>epitax_height</TT>. The x and y
coordinate (x coordinate in 2d) are chosen randomly. However, the
position is chosen in such a way that there is a distance larger than
<TT>epitax_cutoff</TT> between the beam atoms. 
During the simulation, the height of creation of particles is
moved upwards with a velocity corresponding to the IMD parameter
<TT>epitax_speed</TT>. 

<P>

Atoms in the beam are always integrated in the NVE ensemble, that is,
their energy is conserved. The atoms in the substrate are in the
ensemble specified by the IMD parameter
<TT>ensemble</TT> as usual. Atoms that are deposited on the substrate are
integrated with the substrate ensemble where the change of ensemble is
performed as follows. At the beginning of the simulation, the mean
potential energy <I>Epot_mean</I> of the atoms in the substrate 
is computed. The potential energy of the beam atoms initially being
zero, the change of ensemble occurs if the potential energy of the
beam atoms falls below <I>C * Epot_mean</I> where the control
parameter <I>C</I> can be prescribed by the IMD parameter
<TT>epitax_ctrl</TT> (Default 1).
 
<P>

Beam atoms that bounce off the substrate or atoms ablated from the
substrate are removed from the simulation cell when they reach the top
array of cells in the IMD cell decomposition (trap cells in the figure). 

<P>

During the simulation, the atom number and the coordinates of the
created atoms as well as the atom number and the z coordinates of the
deleted atoms are given in the standard output.
