<H1>Release Notes for IMD 1.2</H1>

This document describes changes of IMD 1.2 from the previous version 1.1.
This description is intended for users who have already worked with IMD.

<P><H2>New Features</H2>
<UL>

<P>
<LI> <B>Mean square displacements</B> 
<P>
IMD now allows to compute <A HREF="options.html#msqd">mean square 
displacements</A>.

<P>
<LI> <B>Correlation functions</B> 
<P>
IMD now allows to compute <A HREF="options.html#correl">van Hove 
(self) correlation functions</A>. Still rather buggy.

<P>
<LI> <B>New shear routines</B> 
<P>
A new <A HREF="ensembles.html#mikshear">shear ensemble</A> has been implemented. 

<P>
<LI> <B>Disloc option</B> 
<P>
A new <A HREF="options.html#disloc">disloc option</A> allows to 
selectively write certain particles only. Useful to see dislocations.

<P>
<LI> <B>Improved support for sockets</B> 
<P>
The support for <A HREF="options.html#sock">sockets</A> has been 
improved. These are needed for online visualization.

<P>
<LI> <B>Support for PACX</B> 
<P>
Support for <A HREF="options.html#pacx">PACX libraries</A> has been
added. This is needed for Metacomputing, but also useful if certain 
MPI routines are not available.

<P>
<LI> <B>EAM potentials</B> 
<P>
Support for <A HREF="options.html#eam">EAM potentials</A> has been 
added (RISC only).

<P>
<LI> <B>Three body potentials</B> 
<P>
Support for <A HREF="options.html#ttbp">two- and three-body potentials</A> 
has been added (RISC only).

</UL>

<H2>Important Bug Fixes</H2>
<P>
None so far :-)
