IMD supports several different MD integrators. Many of them correspont
to thermodynamic ensembles. Integrators are selected via the 
<TT>ensemble</TT> parameter.

<UL>

<P><LI><B> nve </B><P>
Constant volume, constant energy ensemble. This is the most reliable
integrator, and thus the main work horse. No particular parameters
are needed, except perhaps the initial temperature starttemp, if not 
all atoms have their velocities given in the configuration file.

<P><LI><B> nvt </B><P>
Constant volume, constant temperature ensemble, with 
Nos&eacute;-Hoover thermostat (more precisely, this is an 
ensemble with external temperature control - the temperature
can actually vary during the simulation). The imposed temperature
varies linearly from starttemp to endtemp (parameters).
A further required parameter is the time constant of the
temperature control, tau_eta. Alternatively, the inverse
of tau_eta, inv_tau_eta, can be specified. For historical
reasons, even the squared inverse isq_tau_eta is accepted.
inv_tau_eta or isq_tau_eta can be zero, which means constant
energy simulation (nve). 
If the option <A HREF=uniax.html>UNIAX</A> is switched on, an 
additional parameter tau_eta_rot is required. It provides the 
time constant for the coupling to the heat bath adjusting the 
temperature for rotational motion. Like tau_eta, its inverse 
inv_tau_eta, or its squared inverse isq_tau_eta, can be used
as parameter.

<P><LI><B> and </B><P>
This is actually an option which can be used together with the 
nve or mik integrators. Every tempintv steps, the velocities
are reinitialized to a random maxwell distribution of the imposed 
external temperature, which is linearly interpolated between starttemp 
and endtemp. With the nve integrator, this corresponds to an NVT
ensemble with Anderson thermostat.

<P><LI><B> npt_iso </B><P>
Constant pressure, constant temperature ensemble, with isotropic 
volume scaling. Nos&eacute;-Hoover type thermostat and volume control 
are employed. Temperature control is as in nvt, with the same parameters.
(Again, if the option  <A HREF=uniax.html>UNIAX</A>
is switched on, an additional parameter tau_eta_rot is required.)
The pressure varies linearly from pressure_start to pressure_end
(parameters). A time constant for the pressure control, tau_xi,
or its inverse inv_tau_xi, or its squared inverse, isq_tau_xi, 
is required as a parameter. If inv_tau_xi or isq_tau_xi is zero, 
the volume remains constant. The cell subdivision includes a 
rescaling tolerance cell_size_tol (parameter), which defaults to 
0.05. If this tolerance is exceeded, the cell subdivision is 
changed on the fly.

<P><LI><B> npt_axial </B><P>
Constant pressure, constant temperature ensemble, 
with volume rescaling along each axis independently.
This works only for <B>orthogonal boxes</B> correctly. 
Works the same way as npt_iso, with the same parameters, except that
the three axial pressures can be specified separately. 

<P><LI><B> mik </B><P>
Microconvergence integrator. After each step, if the velocity of an
atom goes "uphill" in the potential landscape, it is reset to zero. 
No particular parameter is needed, except perhaps the initial
temperature, if not all atoms have their velocities given in the 
configuration file.

<P><LI><B> glok </B><P>
This is an option, which can be used together with the nve integrator.
It works like a global version of mik: if the scalar product of
the global force and momentum vectors (containing the force and
momentum components of all atoms) is negative (momentum goes "uphill"
in the potential landscape), all momenta are reset to zero.
Note that this concerns only translational forces, not the rotational
ones in <a href=uniax.html>UNIAX</a>. glok should relax faster than
mik, which can be verified using the option <A HREF="options.html#fnorm">
fnorm</A>.

<P><LI><B> frac </B><P>
Fracture simulation with stadium damping. Anyone know how this works?
What do the parameters mean? 

<A NAME="nvx">
<P><LI><B> nvx </B><P>
</A>
Used for heat conductivity measurements. Forces a temperature
gradient into the sample.

<P><LI><B> sllod </B><P> SLLOD ensemble for simulation of shear flow
with the help of a deformation rate tensor in combination with
Lees-Edwards boundary conditions. It corresponds to an additional
velocity component applied to every particle in every step. It appears
also in the equation of the momenta so that the particles perform a
motion relatively to the shear flow. The SLLOD algorithm
<STRONG>must</STRONG> be used together with a thermostat and with
periodic boundary conditions in all directions. In 2D a vector
shear_rate must be specified whose two components correspond to the
xy- resp. to the yx-component of the applied deformation rate
tensor. In 3D two vectors with three components, shear_rate and
shear_rate2 must be specified. The components of shear_rate specify
its yz-, the zx-, and its xy-component. The components of shear_rate2
specify its zy-, the xz-, and its yx-component.
